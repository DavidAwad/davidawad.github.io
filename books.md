### The Life of a Professional
#### 100 Life Pro-Tips by David Awad

![]({{ site.baseurl }}public/img/book_cover.png)

This book is a collection of tips, tricks, and jokes that I wrote over the span of my college years— a very formative time in my life, indeed. While going through this time, I took notes on experiences that have really stuck with me. It contains lessons I’ve learned in trying to live my own life. Each of these “pro-tips” contains some commentary from myself that provides additional discussion or context on how that pro-tip came to be. They will probably come across as streams of consciousness, segments of jokes, barside storytelling, and very rare glimmers of poetic insight.
