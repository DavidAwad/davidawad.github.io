> a tiny newsletter for folks interested in crypto and philosophy


I will be honest with you; I hate newsletters. I hit unsubscribe on almost every mailing list ever. Yet here I am pitching you on another damn email list.

*So why the hypocrisy?*

I'm making this newsletter to share and receive feedback on specific resources and ideas that I believe have value. That doesn't always happen "weekly", it happens when I've found something important. It could be just a link, it could be an entire essay.

My personal interests tend to be in computing, economics, physics, and philosophy.
If I ever had any useful information it would be in these areas. We have access to ten times the library of alexandria at our fingertips, there is so much unusual and interesting information on the latest compiler, or news developments in the cairo startup ecosystem. You never know when certain information can come in handy.


So to be clear:

<ul>

    <li class="active">
        I'm not interested in pushing nonsense I don't believe in.
    </li>


    <li class="active">
        I want to share very specific ideas in a format that makes sense to me and more importantly for you.

    </li>


    <li class="active">
        Ideally I want to only share content that is important and factual.
    </li>

</ul>


If this mailing list sounds interesting to you, it would mean a lot if you were to consider subscribing.
