## What is this site?
<p class="message">
Hello! My name is Abanoub David Awad, (or ﺃﺑﺎﻧﻮﺏ ﺩﻳﻔﻴﺪ ﺃﻭﺍﺩ) what you're currently reading is my blog that I've slowly been crafting over the past few years while I tried to find my groove.

It started out as a small publication on medium but as time went on I kept finding additional features I wanted that medium just didn't support. I didn't like that very much as time went on so I decided to just build the blog myself and combined my personal website and my blog together to form this site.
</p>


## More about me:

I'm an aspiring philosopher, web developer, designer, programmer, physicist, mathematician, poet and person. Call me an engineer, call me a scientist, call me a dork, but I'm an Inventor. I have built some of my craziest ideas, from machine learning on large twitter datasets, to brain automated social networks, and self driving cars. I've been to a hackathon every single weekend, and I don't plan on stopping anytime soon. I strongly believe in the original dream of the Free Software Foundation, and any code, or libraries that I write are usually open sourced as soon as they're done (but usually before that!). I spend any and all free time I have reading about all kinds of different technologies, from alternating current theory, to game and graphic design in Unity and Blender, and even lane detection for self driving cars. If I have anything, it is dedication. I will get addicted to my projects, and constatntly try to make them as good as possible. I will move fast. I will break things. I will create, build, tweak and destroy. It's who I am.

All I know is that I want to do and create a lot more while I still have the opportunity. If you wish to contact me please feel free; it is a personal goal of mine to be someone who provides happiness, and support to as many people as I can in my small lifetime, while I build devices that simplify as much of the human experience as possible. That's the dream.

Sincerely,

## Technical Information

Every single part of this site is handled using open source code and infrastructure.

* Built as a static site using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).
* Uses [Poole](http://getpoole.com) for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).
* Themed with [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde).
* The footnotes and side comments are done with [side-comments.js](https://github.com/aroc/side-comments)
* The mathematics used throughout is rendered with [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/)
* The search feature was implemented pretty quickly thanks to [this snippet from alembic](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic/blob/master/_includes/site-search.html#L14-L56).
* The picture of me at the top of this page is written in pure [sass](http://sass-lang.com/) with additional mixins from [bourbon](http://bourbon.io/)

* Page Meta information and SEO is done using [Jekyll-seo-tag](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag)
* The email infrastructure is handled by [SendGrid](http://sendgrid.com) which has some fantastic documentation that made this really easy to do.
* SSL is handled through [cloudflare](cloudflare.com)'s free tier. The connection should be encrypted and authenticated using a strong protocol (TLS 1.2), a strong key exchange (ECDHE_ECDSA with X25519), and a strong cipher (AES_128_GCM).
* It's hosted for free through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
* Uses [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com) for me to be aware of how well my site is doing.
* You can find the [source code here](github.com/davidawad/davidawad.github.io).
