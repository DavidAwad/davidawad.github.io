## Hello,

My name is David Awad, ﺩﻳﻔﻴﺪ عوض . I'm an aspiring **engineer**, **scientist**, and **philosopher**.

We've never met, but you've taken the time to read my personal website. I want to take the time to thank you for doing that. I'll try to keep this open letter somewhat brief.

I grew up in central New Jersey, originally starting college at Rutgers intending to major in musical theater. I eventually found my way to a double major in computer science and physics for my undergraduate studies. Shortly after that I pursued my graduate degree in computer science at Georgia Tech with an emphasis on computing systems and application infrastructure. Somewhere in the middle of this I started a nonprofit with two amazing co-founders that seeks to serve the homeless community, became a teaching assistant with the institute, and have worked as a software engineer in the telecom.


I spend any free time I have exploring different concepts such as alternating current theory, game design, mechanical and kinetic sculpture techniques and tools for thinking about jurisprudence. The hope has always been that these pursuits would guide me towards worldviews rooted in empirical evidence and sound logic. I'm very fortunate to have the opportunity to learn for myself and create value for others. I have even built some of these crazy ideas. I've built machine learning on large twitter datasets, brain wave sharing social networks, automated paralegals, and self driving cars. Fortunately there are still plenty of ideas still on my list! I get addicted to my projects, and constantly try to make them better if I have the time.


I believe in objective truth, personal responsibility, limited government, and individual liberty. I believe that most of what I create is _pro amore rei_, for the love of the quest. Thus, “free” is a matter of *liberty*, not price. I see information the same way, so I try to take the time to create tools that can better help people get access to knowledge. Solving problems that are of value to others and yourself is the most important thing you can do. The world is full of fascinating problems to be solved, and no problem should ever be solved twice.


The purpose of life is to aspire to something greater than yourself and to dedicate your life to it. If my interference will have made the truth more seen, or have better fascilitated the carriage of justice, or brought joy to others through the magic of reality, it would have been a life well lived.

If you believe we can help each other with our goals, then by all means feel free to reach out.

Thanks for taking the time to read my open letter; I hope you find whatever you're looking for.

Sincerely,
