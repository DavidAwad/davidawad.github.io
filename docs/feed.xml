&lt;p&gt;It’s 4/20 and I hadn’t written a blog post in a little while. Instead of the devil’s lettuce I thought, “what better activity could we do?” So let’s clean off the spider webs and crack open our physics textbooks. We’re going to derive the Einstein field equations! I assure you, they’re a hoot and a half! Or at the very least you’ll see a lot of corny Pythagoras jokes, and that’s just as important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Readers should know that general relativity is something you’d only really understand after taking a graduate course in physics. This blog post is not a substitute for that course. But this post does show you a lot of the concepts that were relevant for deriving the theory.
The majority of the derivations here were originally published and refined by Einstein between the years 1905 and 1915. Don’t worry about the math, what’s much more interesting here (for me anyway) is the concepts and how they came about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;history&quot;&gt;History&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of the appeal of learning these equations is the fleeting feeling that perhaps you’re on the same intellectual footing as one of the greats such as einstein. Einstein has always had a perception of being one of the greatest physicists of all time. I think that this perception is a little bit unfair to the other scientists who were doing incredible work at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to start this post with some background on einstein that I found in a very insightful comment on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5lr3mx/how_did_einstein_become_synonymous_with/dby6wes/&quot;&gt;reddit&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s a portion of that comment on how einstein came to be seen as synonymous with intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the early 20th century, there were a handful of scientific heroes. Many of them have not persisted in /public imagination. Almost nobody outside of the sciences today is going to know who Robert Millikan is, but for a time he was the most famous scientist in the United States, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Einstein’s international fame was the result of several distinct events that led him to be branded as “revolutionary” on a level above and beyond his peers (and perhaps above and beyond his accomplishments).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In 1905, when Einstein published his first papers on relativity theory, he was virtually an unknown. For the next decade, he became a little better known in the community of physicists, but even then practically nobody worked on relativity without having a direct personal connection to Einstein in some way. If you look back on those papers with a sober eye today, they are interesting, and the fact that all four of them came out in the same year is rather impressive, but they are not heads-and-tails more revolutionary than other work being done at the time. The paper on the photoelectric effect (for which Einstein got the Nobel Prize in 1921) is important in that it shows that Planck’s idea of the quanta has physical meaning (and is not just a mathematical heuristic, as Planck thought it was), the paper on Brownian motion is an interesting (if not strictly necessary by that time) way to argue for the physical reality of atoms. The $E=mc^2$ paper is an interesting derivation but it was not at all clear it had any physical reality (and nobody, including Einstein, thought it had any practical applications). The length contraction/time dilation (special relativity) paper is an interesting approach to a curious physical puzzle (what happens if you take Galilean relativity seriously, but believe the speed of light is invariant?), but again, doesn’t really get you anything obvious out of the physics, and it wasn’t clear if it was physically real or not. In short, these papers did not shake the world up, but a few people took note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Awareness of Einstein perked up a bit in the 1910s, as he was one of the only German professors to protest against World War I (both the English and German professoriate were largely belligerent and issued long “manifestos” in the name of their countries). In 1915 he published his theory of General Relativity which was much more mathematically complex than his previous work, and much more ambitious in terms of its implications. Here was a new theory of gravity, in the end, one that would explain anomalies with Newton’s theory of gravity, but also would explain what gravity was in a way that Newton could not. This would be of much more interest to astronomers, if it were true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ironically, perhaps, the place where the most latent interest for General Relativity would exist was the United Kingdom, in no small part because the mathematical training required as part of the British tripos system made the British scientists on the whole much more competent at such matters than those scientists on the continent (the German tradition of physics was more strongly rooted in experimental procedure, and the math of General Relativity is of a high-enough order that your average German experimental physicist of that time was not really capable or interested in dealing with it). One British astronomer/physicist, Arthur Eddington, decided in the postwar period that it would be a really splendid thing to see if Einstein’s theory was correct. Eddington had more than scientific motivations: he was a British Quaker, and he thought it would be an impressive demonstration of the unifying powers of science if, in the wake of the Great War, he were to undertake an expedition to prove correct the theory of a German Jew. What could be more international and pacifistic than that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So Eddington put together an expedition to the island of Principe to take photographs of stars near the edge of the Sun during the total solar eclipse of 1919, which, if combined with photographs of the same stars when seen from that position at a time when the Sun was not in the sky, would allow one to see if the starlight had been bent by the gravitational field near the Sun (a prediction of General Relativity). Eddington found that this was so and undertook to /publicize this discovery widely — Newton had been overturned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This received national newspaper coverage worldwide. Now Einstein started being known as the guy who overturned Newton. He quickly became an international celebrity, and he capitalized on this by traveling much, giving lots of lectures (which also conveniently got him outside of Germany, where anti-Einstein and anti-Semitic forces were mobilizing), and writing at length on lots of topics. Because Einstein was not just interested in science. He wrote at length about philosophy, politics, socialism, pacifism… he made a name for himself not just as a scientist but as a /public intellectual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Which, it should be said, still might not have cemented his long legacy. Other scientists did such things. It is not at all clear that Einstein was truly the most intelligent man of his time. He had a lot of competition — there were a lot of smart people around then, including people whose contributions to physics were no less enduring. There were also other /public intellectual scientists of the time, many of whom have been forgotten to all but science historians. Einstein’s physics is clever, but it is less “out of the blue” than it looks if you look at it in its context than in isolation. (Typically when Einstein’s work is taught, it is taught in juxtaposition to people like Newton, not in juxtaposition to the science of his time, which is largely forgotten. If you put Einstein’s work up next to, say, Lorentz and Poincaré, it looks more “of a piece” with what was being done at the time, and his early work looks relatively crude. This does not diminish it, but it is a lesson about the difficulty of properly assessing a scientist without looking at their actual context.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that background in mind, Einstein’s work is some of the most important physics that’s happened in quite a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is going to discuss a lot of the mechanics underneath Einstein’s theory of general relativity, and hopefully give you an understanding of how it came to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;math&quot;&gt;Math&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s start with some basic assumptions that i’m making about you, the reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You should know some calculus and a little bit of linear algebra. It’s gonna come up unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;equivalence&quot;&gt;Equivalence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re in a room with no windows, you can’t tell the difference between being in a box that’s accelerating through space accelerating at $g$, and a box that’s on the earth while experiencing the same force of gravity $g$.
That’s essentially the equivalence principle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Now on earth specifically the value of g varies due to tidal forces but that’s not really the point here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;curvature-of-light&quot;&gt;Curvature of light&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ll also need to know that light bends when traveling through a gravitational field. Let’s be more specific.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine you’re traveling in a windowless room that’s accelerating upward at the speed $g$. If you shoot a laser horizontally across the room you would expect it to land at the same height on the other side of the room. Now of course light travels forward and if the windowless room is accelerating we observe something different. As time moves forward and the room moves upwards, the landing height will become lower and lower by the time the light reaches the other end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000//public/img/relativity/ex_1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The first of what is sure to be many diagrams in this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the light was pointed horizontally forward, but when it reached the other end of the elevator the light was lower on the other side of the room. The light &lt;em&gt;curved&lt;/em&gt;. Because the equivalence principle tells us that we can’t tell the difference between this situation and the situation of the stationary situation on earth when influenced by gravity that results in an interesting conclusion that must be the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That the light must be curved by gravity in order to be true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turned out to be proven during a solar eclipse (that story about Eddington from the &lt;a href=&quot;#history&quot;&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; section) when they were able to see a star that appeared to the right of the sun, despite astronomers knowing for a fact that the star was &lt;strong&gt;behind the sun&lt;/strong&gt;. This meant that the light from that star was being bent around the sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newton’s laws of gravitation gave us a simple way to look at gravitation at that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\vec{F} = G \frac{M  m}{ r^2 }&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;note: here $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ and $m$ are the masses of the two objects, and $r$ is the distance between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But light has no mass… why is it being affected?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was the central problem, and the whole point of why this was a huge deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Einstein says to imagine that spacetime is like a trampoline. When you stand on a trampoline you’ll notice that the space in the trampoline indents around you in response to your weight as you sink in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Apparently standing on a trampoline is the best allegory for spacetime that physicists could come up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you put a marble near you and stand on the trampoline, you’ll notice that the marble rolls towards you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Newton believed that this was because of the gravitation between the two objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Einstein believed that this was the marble moving along the shortest path in curved spacetime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He went on to argue that the same thing was happening on the planetary scale as well. That the earth is rolling along what is really a straight line in curved spacetime around the “disturbance” caused by the mass of the sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/public/img/relativity/rubber.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;note: when we say spacetime here, what we’re referring to is 3 dimensional space coupled with time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;also space and time are “the same thing”. (It’s more honest to say they’re intertwined, but physicists aren’t honest.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Here’s why:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It started when Einstein showed that some basic laws of the universe affect both space and time equally. For example when a train is moving really fast a strange thing happens:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;People who are watching the train see that the time for the train and people inside it slows down.
People inside the train see that the distance in front of them is getting shorter.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;These observations are not in contradiction, both groups (the observers and the people inside the train) are equally right even though one of them is seeing the time is affected and the other one is seeing that the space is affected. So we say that spacetime is affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yes, time is slowed down for those on the train. That is what Einstein discovered. The faster the object is moving the slower its time seems for those who are observing it. It is called special relativity. This only becomes significant if the object is moving extremely fast, close to the speed of light. There is also general relativity which says that also gravity affects time, stronger gravity will slow down time more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Note that the people inside the train will perceive their own time normally, it will only seem slower to the people outside the train. It is also interesting that the poeple inside the train will see that the time is slower (not faster!) for those outside the train. This leads to so called twin paradox and is actually hard to grasp at the beginning, you may need to read something on special relativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-field-equations&quot;&gt;The Field Equations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the formula communly known as the “Einstein field equations”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;R_{\mu \nu} - {1 \over 2}g_{\mu \nu}\,R + g_{\mu \nu} \Lambda =
{8 \pi G \over c^4} T_{\mu \nu}&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, $\mu$ and $\nu$ can be any of the 4 dimensions (values 0 through 3). (accounting for the 3 dimensions and time) Every single parameter can be substituted in any way and the equation will still be true. In this sense it’s more like 16 equations. There are a few duplicates so they reduce to about 10 equations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other constants are ones you’ve seen before:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$\pi$ is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi&quot;&gt;pi&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$G$ is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_constant&quot;&gt;gravitational constant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$c$ is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light&quot;&gt;speed of light&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$\Lambda$ is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_constant&quot;&gt;cosmological constant&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$g_{\mu \nu}$ is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor&quot;&gt;metric tensor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$R_{\mu \nu}$ is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mathworld.wolfram.com/RicciCurvatureTensor.html&quot;&gt;Ricci curvature tensor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$R$ is the curvature scalar.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$T_{\mu \nu}$ is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress%E2%80%93energy_tensor&quot;&gt;stress energy momentum tensor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;you know it’s an important equation when it contains the cool stuff like $\pi$ and $c$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the whole point of this equation is that it balances two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The left side refers to curvature of spacetime&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The right side is about mass and energy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These equations show us that &lt;strong&gt;mass tells spacetime how to curve&lt;/strong&gt; and that &lt;strong&gt;curved spacetime tells mass how to move&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;if this information is satisfactory for you then you can stop reading now, the rest of the post is all math, and who wants that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;metric-tensor&quot;&gt;Metric Tensor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine you are a person standing on a grassy field with lots of hills and you wanted to model your height above sea level as a function of where you moved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you start at your original position in this field from fixed point ($x$, $y$). And let’s represent our height as $\phi$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now when you walk straight through a field with hills you’ll walk up some hills and down others which of course is &lt;em&gt;a change in height&lt;/em&gt;. So to represent our height as a function of which direction we walk in, we will use the following equations for the $x$ and $y$ directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;d \phi = \frac{ d \phi_x}{ d x } dx&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;d \phi = \frac{ d \phi_y}{ d y } dy&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two equations essentially say that the change in height ($d \phi$) can be derived by multiplying the rate of change in that direction, $\frac{ d \phi_x}{ d x } dx$ (also known as the &lt;em&gt;gradient&lt;/em&gt;), and the actual distance you moved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you walk 5 meters down a 1/10 incline, than you’ll be 1/2 a meter lower. (shocking I know.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;becuase $ d \phi_x = \frac{1}{10} \times 5  = \frac{1}{2}m $&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is a quite general form. The value of our field is multiplied by the gradient, or change in field, times the distance you traveled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course a 1/10 slope isn’t going to happen at your grandma’s favorite park, but it will happen at &lt;em&gt;much smaller distances&lt;/em&gt;! (This is why we have $dx$. Which means unfortunately calculus is probably involved.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- walking 5 meters in that direction. --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to deal with one other thing. People don’t walk in boring straight lines like $x$ and $y$. Straight lines suck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s get a little more abstract. Any path along a $2d$ field is going to involve components of $x$ and $y$. So let’s represent all possible paths as a combination of the two in a more generic equation. We’ll call our combined path $s$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve done literally any physics ever you know that to combine these vectors we need to talk to the hotdog choreographer himself, mac daddy &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras&quot;&gt;pythagoras&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;this will give us the &lt;em&gt;magnitude&lt;/em&gt; (or length) of the combined vector $s$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course we can add these vectors as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\vec{ds} = \vec{dx} + \vec{dy}&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So our representation of height as a function of movement along path $s$ looks very similar, we’re just adding the changes in height contributed by the movement along each direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;d \phi_s = d \phi_x + d \phi_y&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;if you needed more foreshadowing here, you can probably abstract this concept to as many dimensions as you want…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that we can do another substitution based on what we’ve already done earlier with the $x$ and $y$ direction and add in our definitions for $d \phi_x$ and $d \phi_y$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;d \phi_s  = \frac{ \partial \phi_x }{ \partial x } dx  + \frac{ \partial \phi_y }{ \partial y } dy&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yes I know, we switched from $d$ to $\partial$, this is just a semantic distinction to make clearer for the &lt;em&gt;math people&lt;/em&gt; that the rate of change is specific to the variable we’re looking at in that term, but not the only rate of change we care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So up until now we’ve been using $x$ and $y$. Again we could use any set of coordinates here, variables are just labels after all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s abstract further, and our equations that we’ve been building so far will use different variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll switch $x$ with $x_1$ and $y$ with $x_2$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;d \phi  = \frac{ \partial \phi_{x_1} }{ \partial {x_1} } dx_1  + \frac{ \partial \phi_{x_2} }{ \partial x_2 } dx_2&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That leaves us with the convenient feature of being able to consider further terms and abstract to as many dimensions as we want. So we can go up to $n$ dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;cd-testimonials-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equation 1:&lt;/p&gt;

$$ d \phi = \sum_n  \frac{ \partial \phi_{x_n} }{ \partial {x_n} } dx_n $$

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That weird $\sum$ just means we add up all the terms based on $n$, if $n$ is $2$ we’d get the equation above we just made. On a totally unrelated note look how awesome that math term looks. You just know we cooked up some serious bullshit right there… uh, let’s continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we’ve done a lot of math relating gradients and their effects from the &lt;em&gt;reference frame of a single observer&lt;/em&gt; about their height as they walk through a field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we know from earlier that time and space are related in strange ways that result in time dilation and length contraction. That “reality is observed differently” by observers in different reference frames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we’re ever going to make a statement that’s universally true, it has to be true in every possible frame of reference as well. The first thing we’d need to be able to do is model the two reference frames and relate them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if two people are walking through the same grassy field, how would we model all the gradients of person $x$ from the perspective of person $y$?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well it turns out we can do this. Let’s say we want to model all the gradients of person $x_2$: we’d use the chain rule to parse out what that looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’m going to use $y_1$ reference frame as an example. Meaning observing all the gradients of x from an observer in the “y_1” dimension. That hill analogy is certainly getting a little strange but bear with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\frac{ \partial \phi }{ \partial y_n }  = \frac{ \partial \phi }{ \partial x_1 }         \frac{ \partial x_1 }{ \partial y_1 }         +  \frac{ \partial \phi }{ \partial x_2 }  \frac{ \partial x_2 }{ \partial y_1 }&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you’ll notice this can also be abstracted to an arbitary number of dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;cd-testimonials-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equation 2:&lt;/p&gt;
$$ \frac{ \partial \phi }{ \partial y_n }  = \sum_m   \frac{ \partial \phi }{ \partial x_m }   \frac{ \partial x_m }{ \partial y_n }   $$

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;note: here we’re using $m$ as our summation variable, and using $n$ as an identifier for the dimension of our observer. We don’t have to be using $y_1$ here, it could be $x$, $y$, $z$, $t$, $etc.$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tensors&quot;&gt;Tensors&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it’s about time we talked about tensors.  The whole point of all of this crap has been to talk about the metric tensor yet we still haven’t gotten to it. Let’s talk about what a tensor is for a bit and then we can get to the good stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;cd-testimonials-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equation 3: the vector transform&lt;/p&gt;

$$ V_y^n  = \sum_m \frac{ \partial y^n }{ \partial x^m } V_x^m $$

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can modify our equations from earlier a little bit to develop something you could call the &lt;strong&gt;vector transform&lt;/strong&gt;. Essentially meaning that the $n$th coordinate of a vector in the $y$ frame of reference is equal to the sum of the gradient term times the $n$th coordinate in the $x$th frame of reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea here is essentially for a vector with $n$ coordinates we can construct a representation of a vector from the perspective of $y$ by “transforming” the vector from the x representation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be helpful to start with scalars first. A scalar is a quantity with no direction associated with it, temperature is a good example of this. Contrast this with a vector which is just a scalar with a direction (like velocity).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could think of a scalar as a tensor of rank 0. Then a vector is like a tensor of rank 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now a tensor could be thought of as a combination of vectors &lt;strong&gt;where there is a fixed relationship between the two&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine the example of a block being pushed by a force:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/public/img/relativity/ex_2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;try to ignore that weird angle bend in the image i’m trying my best here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there are two forces here, $\vec{F}$ and $\vec{G}$, note that only $\vec{F}$ actually moves the box, and it’s moved a distance $x$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you imagine that $\vec{F}$ is the only force acting on the box, we know that the work done on the box will be equivalent to the force times the distance along the direction that the box moves in. Now of course there’s an $x$ and $y$ component to the force that’s acting &lt;em&gt;diagonally&lt;/em&gt; on the box so we have to do something different here to evaluate the work done on the box in the $x$ direction and we can resolve that problem pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;W = \vec{F} \cos{ \theta } \dot x&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s all fine. Now lets think about $\vec{G}$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;W = \vec{G} \cos{ \theta } \dot x = 0&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work done by $\vec{G}$ is $0$ because $\cos{90}$ is $0$. But more obviously if you push down on a block it won’t move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This basic mechanics example has an important property. &lt;strong&gt;No matter what reference frame&lt;/strong&gt; you view $\vec{G}$ from, the outcome is exactly the same. The block does not move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A tensor is the relationship between two vectors.&lt;/strong&gt; If a tensor has a value of $0$ in one frame of reference, it has a value of $0$ in &lt;strong&gt;all frames of reference&lt;/strong&gt;. The block never moves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might guess that this concept is going to be very useful in our discussion of Einsteins theories of relativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ugh I sound like such a textbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s bring it on home. Imagine two vectors (who cares what they are):
We’ll look at the $m$th dimension of $A$ and the $nth$ dimension of $B$. We’ll say that the combination of the two creates a tensor of &lt;em&gt;rank&lt;/em&gt; 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;T^{mn} = A^m B^n&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now there’s something important to point out here, which is that $m$ and $n$ are &lt;strong&gt;dimensions&lt;/strong&gt;. In our examples so far we’ve been in the $x$ $y$ plane so $m$ and $n$ both are either $1$ or $2$. This means there are &lt;strong&gt;four possible tensors to create between the two vectors&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have $3$ dimensions in space, then there are 9 different versions of $T^{mn}$ and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now what would $A$ and $B$ look like from the reference frame of $y$? Let’s use our equation 3 from earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;A^m_y B^n_y = \sum_r  \frac{  \partial y^m }{ \partial x^r }  A^r_x  +  \sum_s  \frac{  \partial y^m }{ \partial x^s }  B^s_x&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now let’s simplify that a little bit with some condensing, and we get toooooo&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;cd-testimonials-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equation 4: the contravariant transformation&lt;/p&gt;

$$ T_y^{mn} = \sum_{r,s} \frac{ \partial y^m }{ \partial x^r }   \frac{ \partial y^n }{ \partial x^s }           A^r_x  B^s_x $$

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll notice that this is an equation that enables you to transform $A^r_x B^s_x$, (better known as T_x^{rs}) into T_y^{mn}. Hence it is known as the contravariant transformation. If you’d like to make this harder to understand &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariant_transformation&quot;&gt;feel free to check out wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;this is getting harder to follow along in an obvious way. I know. I’m sorry. For what it’s worth, writing this all out and formatting the math has been a nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s an alternate version of equation 4 that you should know about&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;cd-testimonials-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equation 5: the covariant transformation&lt;/p&gt;

$$ T_{mn}(y) = \sum_rs \frac{\partial x^r }{ \partial y^m} \frac{\partial x^s}{ \partial y^n } T_{rs} (x) $$

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we’ve come a long way talking about a lot of stuff that’s not the metric tensor. Like most physics textbooks we’re going to continue that trend by taking yet another look at the justin beiber of philosphers, that’s right. The mac daddy pythagorean theorem. Like good physicists we’ll draw a fun diagram and apply what we know to arrive at something we don’t. Afterwards, again like most physics students we’ll think we understand it after reading it and then fail to reproduce it in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/public/img/relativity/ex_3.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s examine this example triangle. Obviously the variable names for the lengths of the sides are completely coincidental.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll start with an initial pythagorean understanding of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;ds^2 = {dx^1}^2 + {dx^2}^2&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now what you might have heard is that the phantom menace pythagoras wrote a theorem is actually just a specific instance of a more generalized rule. We can actually expand it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;ds^2 = {dx^1}^2 + {dx^2}^2 + ...&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we can restate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;ds^2 = \sum_{mn} dx^m  dx^n \times \delta_{mn}&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for this to still be consistent, we have to make sure we’re not taking any products we don’t want in the sum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so that’s that that $\delta$ is for. That $\delta$ there is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronecker_delta&quot;&gt;Kronecker Delta&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The kronecker delta is a funky machine. Essentially on every iteration of the sum operation for new values of $m$ and $n$, $\delta$ is evaluated to be either 0 or 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So if $m = n$ then $\delta = 1$, and otherwise $\delta = 0$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The delta is essentially a scaling factor so we can take it out like anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;ds^2 = \delta_{mn} \sum_{mn} dx^m  dx^n&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we can use our definition from before:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;dx^m = \frac{ \partial x^m }{ \partial y^r } dy^r&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we apply that to our working definition of $ds^2$,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;ds^2 = \delta_{mn} \sum_{m n}    \frac{ \partial x^m }{ \partial y^r } dy^r    \frac{ \partial x^n }{ \partial y^s } dy^s&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we’ve got something quite powerful. Let’s just rearrange this for a second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;ds^2 = \delta_{mn} \sum_{m n}  \frac{ \partial x^m }{ \partial y^r }  \frac{ \partial x^n }{ \partial y^s }  dy^r  dy^s&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there it is. The beautiful metric tensor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;cd-testimonials-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The metric tensor&lt;/p&gt;

$$ g_{mn} = \delta_{mn} \sum_{m n}  \frac{ \partial x^m }{ \partial y^r }  \frac{ \partial x^n }{ \partial y^s } $$

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So… what does that really mean?
Like most physics courses, we’ve barely said anything about physics for about 10 minutes and spent the majority of our time doing derivations. All we have is some cool looking math to show for it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand what the metric tensor &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; let’s look at the original sinetist (heh), pimp daddy pythagoras just one more time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/public/img/relativity/ex_3.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;ds^2 = {dx^1}^2 + {dx^2}^2&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back at our more generalized approach from before, take a look at what happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;ds^2 = g_{mn} dy^r  dy^s&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So our normal pythagorean theorem is functional for flat space. In &lt;em&gt;flat space&lt;/em&gt; it’s perfectly true that we can use the normal pythagorean theoem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now imagine we have that same right triangle drawn on a sphere. We wouldn’t be in flat space anymore, if we had the same right triangle on the surface of a sphere, we still couldn’t use meme lord pythagoras. So what the &lt;strong&gt;metric tensor&lt;/strong&gt; gives us, is a device that &lt;strong&gt;corrects for operating in curved space&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So i’m sure you can see how this is going to be valuable when operating in curved space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So our $g_{\mu \nu}$ term works in that way, and that’s what that term is when looking at the field equations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;note that the $\mu \nu$ terms there are just a convention that is often used when talking about spacetime. Again, they’re just indicators for whatever dimensions you’re condidering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-christoffel-symbols&quot;&gt;The Christoffel Symbols&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important thing about tensors is that they represent a relationship between two vectors that’s true in all reference frames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;let’s imagine a tensor $W_{nm}(x) = V_{nm}(x)$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the problem. One thing that will come up pretty quickly when examinig tensors is that the derivatives of tensors don’t have the same powerful fixed properties that derivatives of vectors do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are the derivatives of tensors the same?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we look at the derivative of $V$ with respect to $x$ in the $x$ frame of reference, &lt;strong&gt;does that equal&lt;/strong&gt; the derivative of $V$ with respect to $y$ in the $y$ frame of reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;T_{mn} (x) = \frac{ \partial V_m }{ \partial x^n }(x)&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;T_{mn} (y) = \frac{ \partial V_m }{ \partial y^n }(y)&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does $ T_{mn}(x) = T_{mn}(y)$ ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look again at equation 5:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;T_{mn}(y) = \sum_rs \frac{\partial x^r }{ \partial y^m} \frac{\partial x^s}{ \partial y^n } T_{rs} (x)&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can use that and apply it to our question substituting $T_{rs}(x)$ for $T_{mn}(y)$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We’re substituting it in which is why we’re using $rs$ instead of $mn$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;T_{mn}(y) = \sum_rs \frac{\partial x^r }{ \partial y^m} \frac{\partial x^s}{ \partial y^n }  \frac{ \partial V_r (x) }{ \partial x^s }&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which simplifies :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;T_{mn}(y) = \sum_rs \frac{\partial x^r }{ \partial y^m} \frac{  \partial V_r (x) }{ \partial y^n }&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, what we’re trying to determine, is if $T_{mn} (y)$ is equal to $ \frac{ \partial V_m (y) }{ \partial y^n }$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll save some time here and just show what $ \frac{ \partial V_m (y) }{ \partial y^n }$  is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\frac{ \partial V_m (y) }{ \partial y^n }  =  \frac{\partial x^r }{ \partial y^m} \frac{ \partial V_r (x) }{ \partial y^n } + \frac{\partial  }{\partial y^n}   \frac{ \partial x^r  V_r (x) }{ \partial y^m }&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;note that the $\sum$ still applies here. I just didn’t write it.
Einstein actually believed that writing it out was trivial and that it was implied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So upon examination it turns out they’re unfortunately not equal. They’re quite close!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you look a little closer the only difference between the two tensors is those extra terms at the end of $ \frac{ \partial V_m (y) }{ \partial y^n } $.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;here’s those terms again just to be clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\frac{\partial }{\partial y^n} \frac{ \partial x^r  V_r (x) }{ \partial y^m }&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those extra symbols at the end there are called the christoffel symbols, and are often abbreviated as $\Gamma_{nm}^r$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the question we asked was is if $T_{mn} (y) = \frac{ \partial V_m (y) }{ \partial y^n }$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We found the answer is no, however we can still work with this using something called the covariant derivative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;cd-testimonials-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equation 7:&lt;/p&gt;

$$T_{mn} (y) =  \nabla_{n}  \partial V_m (y)  =   \frac{ \partial V_m (y) }{ \partial y^n } + \Gamma_{nm}^r V_r(x) $$

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The christoffel symbols exist as a correction for the transformation of the derivative of a tensor from one reference frame to another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we did that for vectors, and now we’ll need to do it for tensors. So let’s look at the covariant derivative of $T_{mn}$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;cd-testimonials-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equation 8:&lt;/p&gt;

$$  \nabla_p T_{mn} = \frac{ \partial T_{mn}  }{ \partial  y^p } + \Gamma_{pm}^r  T_{nr} + \Gamma_{pn}^r  T_{mr} $$

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there we have it! That’s the transformation of a tensor from one frame of reference to another! Swag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So just a quick concept check, what would the covariant derivative be of $g_{mn}$ in flat space?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\nabla_r g_{mn} (x) = 0&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The covariant tensor of the metric tensor in flat space is zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In flat space the metric tensor is either 1 or 0. Either way it’s a constant, and the derivative of any constant is zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Here’s how that would apply within equation 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\nabla_p g_{mn} = \frac{ \partial g_{mn}  }{ \partial  y^p } + \Gamma_{pm}^r  g_{rn} +  \Gamma_{pn}^r  g_{mr} = 0&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;P.S. If professor Schnetzer at Rutgers is somehow reading this, here’s a free exam question for you next time you teach General Relativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we can rearrange this with the help of some crazy mathematicians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;cd-testimonials-wrapper&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equation 9:&lt;/p&gt;
$$  \Gamma^a_{bc} (x) = \frac{1}{2} g^{ad}  \Bigg\{    \frac{ \partial g_{dc}  }{  \partial x^b } + \frac{  \partial g_{ab} }{  \partial x^c } - \frac{ \partial g_{ab} }{ \partial x^d } \Bigg\}  $$
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we have our equation for the christoffel symbol in terms of first derivatives of the metric tensor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if you’re wondering why we care about the christoffel symbol, it’s because it’s a part of the ricci curvature tensor which &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a part of Einstein’s equation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;curvature&quot;&gt;Curvature&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re going to have to define some other operations before wee can go on to the ricci tensor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commutators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a commutator operation on some sample matrices $A$ and $B$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;[ A, B ] = AB - BA&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ricci-tensor&quot;&gt;Ricci Tensor&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the Ricci tensor is the part of the curvature of spacetime that determines the degree to which matter will tend to converge or diverge in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may be slightly misleading, so i apologize if it sounds confusing. Vectors change due to curvature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This change can be modeled in the following way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;dV = \frac{ \partial }{ \partial x^{\mu} } \frac{\partial }{ \partial x^{\nu} } V [ \nabla_{\nu}, \nabla_{\mu} ]&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You can break this down using that down that commutation definition and equation 7. I’m gonna skip it for now and leave this as an exercise for some non-lazy reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ricci tensor is made of christoffel symbols and derivatives of christoffel symbols, which themselves are made of metric tensors and the derivatives of metric tensors. And metric tensors, again are simply a tool to correct for the happy slapper mac daddy pythagoras when applying his nonsense in 3d.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the Ricci tensor $R_{\mu \nu}$ is the $ [ \nabla_{\nu}, \nabla_{\mu} ] $ terms in our model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;i’m skipping a few steps to save time, mostly because typing out latex to this extent is a nightmare ~&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could be called the Riemann tensor, but for the purposes of relativity we’ll say that this is the Ricci Tensor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;curvature-scalar&quot;&gt;Curvature Scalar&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll save some time and say that from the ricci tensor, you can derive the curvature scalar. It’s simply a scalar, not a tensor, not a vector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point here is if the curvature scalar is not $0$, then the surface is not flat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stress-energy-momentum-tensor&quot;&gt;Stress Energy Momentum Tensor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with a quick definition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Geodecic - the shortest line between two points that must travel along a curve. Examples are things like the equator, and any line drawn on a sphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s imagine what it looks like if we take a tangent vector of a geodecic.
We can define a tangent vector as a rate of change of the distance we travel with respect to time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wheat we’re interested in is to find the minimum path along a geodecic by taking the derivative and setting it equal to zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now remember we have to take the covariant derivative here because 3d so we’ll use equation 7:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\nabla \frac{d x^{\mu}}{ d \tau }  = \frac{ \partial }{ \partial \tau }  \frac{ \partial x^{mu} }{\partial \tau} + \Gamma = 0&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;here $\tau$ is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_time&quot;&gt;proper time&lt;/a&gt;.
the gamma term is larger but we’re going to move it around in a moment so i haven’t expanded it here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can simplify the time derivative:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\nabla \frac{d x^{\mu}}{ d \tau }  = \frac{ \partial^2 x^{\mu}  }{ \partial \tau^2 } + \Gamma = 0&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting, that $  \frac{ \partial^2 x^{\mu}  }{ \partial \tau^2 } $ is a second derivative of distance with respect to time. That sounds a lot like acceleration. #foreshadowing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s re-arrange this equation for minimum path through a curved space. Now remember that when operating in normal 3d space we should ideally arrive at Newton’s equations which were seen as accurate for so long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially newton’s laws and Einstein’s relativity must conform to the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\frac{ \partial^2 x^{\mu}  }{ \partial \tau^2 } + \Gamma = 0&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\frac{ \partial^2 x^{\mu}  }{ \partial \tau^2 } = - \Gamma&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\sum \vec{F} = m \vec{a}&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this means is that effectively this christoffel term has a broad equivalence to &lt;strong&gt;force&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\Gamma \equiv \frac{\vec{F}}{ m }&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;going back to equation 9, we have a formula for Gamma that we’ve already derived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\Gamma^a_{bc} (x) = \frac{1}{2} g^{ad}  \Bigg\{    \frac{ \partial g_{dc}  }{  \partial x^b } + \frac{  \partial g_{ab} }{  \partial x^c } - \frac{ \partial g_{ab} }{ \partial x^d } \Bigg\}&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now lets consider a low gravity, low speed situation. We expect that from this formula we will find an equivalent for the newtownian version of gravity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s look back here, in normal space almost all of those terms become incredibly small except for the component of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So our equation becomes $ \Gamma \equiv \frac{1}{2} \frac{ \partial g_{0, 0} }{ \partial x } \equiv \vec{F} $&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course in newtownian mechanics, force is proportional to the negative change in potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;F = - \frac{ d \phi }{ dx}&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if the potential near the earth is $\phi = mgx$ where x is the height off of the earth then the force will be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;F = - \frac{d \phi }{dx} = -mg&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we just found the christoffel symbol is equivalent to the force term which is equivalent to the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\Gamma \equiv \frac{1}{2} \frac{ \partial g_{0, 0} }{ \partial x } \equiv \vec{F} =  - \frac{d \phi }{dx}&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, $g_{0 0} = 2 \phi + C$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s continue this argument by making a series of auxillary points that will become clearer after we’re done (Classic &lt;del&gt;jerk&lt;/del&gt; physicist move). Let’s imagine we’ve placed a test mass $m$ at a certain distance $r_p$ out from the center of a planet with mass $M$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cosmology/images/conjunction.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now according to newtownian gravitation this is what we have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;F = - \frac{ G M}{ r_p^2}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;our unit mass will be of size $m=1$ so it dissapears here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if we wanted to find the force capability across the whole of that surface of that sphere,
it would be the integral of the force across the area of that sphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\int F \cdot  dA&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Substituting in the equations for area of a circle and force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\int - \frac{ G M}{ r^2} \cdot  4 \pi r^2&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’m switching from $r_p$ to just $r$ for convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\int F \cdot d A = - G M  4 \pi&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we go on, there’s more stuff we have to cover. There is a theorem called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergence_theorem&quot;&gt;divergence theorem&lt;/a&gt;. You can look it up there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Divergence: the inner product of the operator $\nabla$ and a given vector, which gives a measure of the quantity of flux emanating from any point of the vector field or the rate of loss of mass, heat, etc., from it. - mathematics definition from google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\int_{area} F \cdot dA  = \int_{vol} \nabla F dV&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It says that the integral of $F \cdot d A$ over an area is equal to the integral over the volume of $\nabla F \cdot dV$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What that means in normal terms is that the outward flux through the area of a sphere is equal to the volume integral of the divergence of the force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux&quot;&gt;Flux&lt;/a&gt; describes the quantity which passes through a surface or substance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also I’m just going to quickly remind you that density is mass divided by volume. circa like, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes&quot;&gt;Archimedes&lt;/a&gt; probably.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\rho = \frac{M}{V}&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition of course that means that the mass of an object will be an integral of the density with respect to the volume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;M = \int \rho d V&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So then, we’ve calculated $\int F \cdot dA$ and we’ve got an equation for M as well. So let’s patch it up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;- G 4 \pi \int \rho \cdot dV = \int_{vol} \nabla F \cdot dV&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;we replace M with  $\int \rho d V$ for our definition of $F \cdot d A$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the $dV$ terms “cancel” out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we’re left with is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\nabla F = - 4 \pi G \rho&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So then let’s break this down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far we have shown :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;F = - \nabla \phi&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\nabla F = - 4 \pi G \rho&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\nabla - \nabla \phi  =  - 4 \pi G \rho&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\nabla^2  \phi  = 4 \pi G \rho&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and remember earlier we showed that the time component of the metric tensor $g_{0, 0}$ is equal to $2 \phi + C$ plus some constant leftover from that christoffel term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;g_{0,0} = 2 \phi + C&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and lastly that $\phi$ is $\frac{1}{2} g_{0,0} $&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\phi = \frac{1}{2} g_{0,0} + C&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;which means that once we put these together we get to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\nabla^2 \frac{1}{2} g_{0,0} = 4 \pi G \rho&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;the constant term dissapears here because we’ve taken a derivative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then we find that :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\nabla^2 g_{0,0} = 8 \pi G \rho&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only problem is that this isn’t a tensor equation! we’re supposed to have $\mu$s and $\nu$s in there somewhere!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;almost fun fact:  $ \nabla^2 g_{0,0} $ is sometimes called the Einstein tensor, $G_{\mu \nu}$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So intead of $\rho$ ideally we’d want some tensor to represent energy as well as pressure / density.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;G_{\mu \nu}  = 8 \pi G T_{\mu \nu}&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we’d need to come up with a $T_{\mu \nu}$ as well as something with a $G_{\mu \nu}$ tensor as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there’s a definition for something called a momentum 4 vector, in which we have 3 components of space and 1 vector of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\rho = m (   \frac{x_0}{ \tau }, \frac{x_1}{ \tau }  \frac{x_2}{ \tau }  \frac{x_3}{ \tau }  )&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;note that here $\tau$ is again the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_time&quot;&gt;proper time&lt;/a&gt;, and $m$ is mass.
$\frac{x_0}{ \tau } $ corresponds to the time dimension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saving myself some time here because this is the longest and most painful blog post to write, ever, you can reduce these and see what physical components they correspond to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\rho = m ( mc^2, mv_x, mv_y, mv_z)&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this vector resolves to basic rest mass energy, plus the momentum vectors in the 3 coordinates of physical space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what we want here isn’t a vector $\rho$, but a tensor $T_{\mu \nu}$. This actually finds itself in the form of a matrix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$T_{0,0}$&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$T_{0,1}$&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$T_{0,2}$&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$T_{0,3}$&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$T_{1,0}$&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$T_{1,1}$&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$T_{1,2}$&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$T_{1,3}$&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$T_{2,0}$&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$T_{2,1}$&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$T_{2,2}$&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$T_{2,3}$&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$T_{3,0}$&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$T_{3,1}$&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$T_{3,2}$&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$T_{3,3}$&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we’re seeing is a relationship between the vectors based on the different values of $\mu$ and $\nu$ that will isolate different aspects of space when constructing the equation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example $T_{0}{0}$ is just the time component of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress%E2%80%93energy_tensor&quot;&gt;stress energy momentum tensor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a good diagram that shows how the tensor contains information about various different aspects of spacetime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/StressEnergyTensor_contravariant.svg/472px-StressEnergyTensor_contravariant.svg.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is sort of like units of Energy per unit volume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\frac{Energy}{volume} = \frac{work}{volume} = \frac{force \cdot d }{ d^3 } = \frac{force }{ d^2 } = \frac{force}{area} = pressure&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there we are! that’s how we arrive at keeping our units consistent throughout this whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;G_{\mu \nu}  = 8 \pi G T_{\mu \nu}&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so now we have our mass term on the right hand side. We’ve solved our problem for T_{\mu \nu}. But what should our &lt;em&gt;space time curvature term&lt;/em&gt; be on the left hand side?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;G_{\mu \nu}  = 8 \pi G T_{\mu \nu}&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-cosmological-constant&quot;&gt;The Cosmological Constant&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Einstein thought that the ricci curvature tensor $R_{\mu \nu}$ would be a good candidate to be this $G_{\mu \nu}$ term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only problem is conservation of energy prevents this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I swear we’re almost at the end of the blog post. Just like a physics lecture, we’re so far into the derivation that we’re barely aware of why we’re even doing this anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were to take the derivative of the right hand side, you’d get zero. Unfortunately if you took a derivative of the ricci tensor on the left hand side it would not be zero. Meaning that this equation is physically impossible in it’s current state because energy is not conserved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Einstein found that the derivative of the ricci tensor was the following:
&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\nabla  R_{\mu \nu} = \frac{1}{2} \nabla g_{\mu \nu } R&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;note: it’s a good practice to always use covariant derivatives when doing this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now let’s set our newly found $R_{\mu \nu}$ to $0$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;\nabla ( R_{\mu \nu} - \frac{1}{2}  g_{\mu \nu} R ) = 0&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we can put our modified $G_{\mu \nu}$ and $T_{\mu \nu}$ back into our equation setup on the correct sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;R_{\mu \nu} - \frac{1}{2}  g_{\mu \nu} R =  \frac{8 \pi G T_{\mu \nu} }{c^4}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;we need that $c^4$ for spacial reasons, it also corrects the units. Plus why not it’s relativity bro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Einstein realized at this point that he had forgotten something. The equation only worked correctly when adding an additional tensor and scaling it by a constant. You see, at the time everyone believed that space was fixed, and was mostly unmoving. Yes the earth rotated around the sun but space on the whole didn’t really move around. That’s what people thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;cd-testimonials-wrapper&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        Bruh, so if the outer space isn't moving, shouldn't gravity be forcing the universe to collapse together? Obviously that shit ain't happening fam, so I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say something is preventing it.
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;cd-author&quot;&gt;
        &lt;img src=&quot;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-EmIkaYewYZM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAGYM/UzH1yuoNiZ0/photo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Author image&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;ul class=&quot;cd-author-info&quot;&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Albert Einstein (probably)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That thing that was preventing it? &lt;del&gt;Abraham Lincoln&lt;/del&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The cosmological constant.&lt;/strong&gt;
It’s actually quite small and is usually left out. It’s typically only relevant when talking about large cosmological scales which is why you may see that it’s left out sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So he added in another metric tensor term, and scaled it by the cosmological constant, and here we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;R_{\mu \nu} - \frac{1}{2}  g_{\mu \nu} R + \Lambda g_{\mu \nu} =  \frac{8 \pi G T_{\mu \nu} }{c^4}&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;swag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;!-- The 8π gets the Newtonian limit exactly right. The factor of 4π comes from integration over a sphere, when integrating the gravitational potential into a force. --&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t meant to be a typical blog post per se, but more like a guide on what you should do throughout the process of dealing with a ticket.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#court&quot;&gt;Court&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s imagine some &lt;strong&gt;random&lt;/strong&gt; scenario, it’s 1am, you’re driving home through NJ from philly to get home. You’re always in Philly late, you know you shouldn’t be staying out too long, but somehow now matter what you always get tempted into staying there, something something magic of the city. The reason isn’t important. There’s nobody on the road, and you just want to get home, so you’re just driving. Driving quick, and bam, the lights flash, the siren blares, and you’ve pulled over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;when-you-get-pulled-over&quot;&gt;When you get pulled over:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re going to want to leave a good impression, but not a memorable one. Just be polite and it will be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hands &lt;strong&gt;on&lt;/strong&gt; the wheel, engine &lt;strong&gt;off&lt;/strong&gt;, lights inside the car &lt;strong&gt;on&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Polite&lt;/strong&gt;, don’t be a jerk. When the officer asks you for your license and registration, ask him if it is ok that you reach into glovebox/center console to retrieve it &lt;strong&gt;BEFORE&lt;/strong&gt; you give it to him. Cops are always wary from not knowing if a person is a going to cause a problem or not. This will put him a bit at ease.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DON’T ADMIT TO ANYTHING.&lt;/strong&gt; Do not say something stupid like the following: “Why yes sir I was speeding. Thank you for this ticket!” Let him tell you what &lt;strong&gt;HE THINKS&lt;/strong&gt; you did. Make sure to take note of exactly what he says. This information is &lt;em&gt;important&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DON’T ARGUE WITH THE OFFICER.&lt;/strong&gt; It is ok to question what happened, but don’t make it into argument. You can always say something like “Really? I’m quite sure I was driving with the flow of traffic” or “My speedometer was reading at the speed limit.” It is best to let him do the talking and ask questions in a vague manner rather than challenge his judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ASK QUESTIONS.&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t do this in a suspicious manner. The cop might get a hint that you want to fight the ticket if you get pushy. Act like you are clueless.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Types of questions to ask:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you catch me?&lt;/strong&gt; If it was by radar ask what the reading was and if you can see it. Small things like him saying “75 or so” are crucial to your benefit. The less accurate he is, the better chance you have of succeeding. If he says he was pacing you, ask what that means so he describes it to you (appearing clueless).&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long he was following you and from where&lt;/strong&gt;. Make sure to take mental notes of all this. Remember, you don’t want the officer to actually remember that much about you, you want to seem like a totally routine traffic stop to him.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;commentable-area&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p data-section-id=&quot;1&quot; class=&quot;commentable-section&quot;&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;COUNTY SEAT:&lt;/b&gt; If at this point he has decides to write you a ticket, ask if you can have it sent to the county seat. The &lt;b&gt;county seat&lt;/b&gt; is the main branch in the county of where the ticket is issued. There are two reasons to do this:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        First, the main branch is usually not the officer’s home branch, sometimes it might be pretty far. This means he is less likely to show up in court should he have to go, because it is more work for him to drive there.
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        Second, the ticket might get lost in the process. It's not that likely, but whatever you can do to put things in your favor. If he asks why, just tell him that you work near there or something. He cannot refuse this right and if he does &lt;b&gt;take note of it&lt;/b&gt;.
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;after-you-receive-your-ticket&quot;&gt;After you receive your ticket&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write everything down!&lt;/strong&gt; Once everything is settled and you are now on your way again, pull over somewhere and write down or record every detail you can remember. Every detail includes: weather, date, time, traffic conditions, where the sun was at, lane you were in, lane he was in, what the conversation entailed (how fast he said you were going, how he caught you etc.) The more info you have the better your case. Take lots of pictures of the area if you can. Or use google earth photos.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delay, delay, delay.&lt;/strong&gt; Look at the date you are due in court. Call the a couple of days before and get an extension &lt;em&gt;also known as a continuance&lt;/em&gt;. You will receive one, and you can always make up an excuse for one. 2 weeks before your next court date try to get another extension. You may or may not get one. I did. The longer time between you and the court date the more time has passed and the less likely the cop will be able to recall you or information about the violation. There are even circumstances where it’s been so long that the officer isn’t even serving in your jurisdiction anymore and the ticket can be dismissed automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Police Report&lt;/strong&gt;: get a copy of the police report and go through it thoroughly. Make sure that every blank that should be filled out is filled out to the T. I’m not sure if getting a copy prior to court is free or not, but if you get to the point of court, you should be offered a copy then to look over. You may also just get a kickass judge like I did who will offer to look it over for you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;contesting-your-ticket&quot;&gt;Contesting your ticket&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trial by Written Declaration:&lt;/strong&gt; Read the citation and dig into what the rules are in your state for trial by written declaration. A written declaration essentially means you write up your case as opposed to showing up in court. Even if you lose this case, you can go to court in person anyway, which of course is up to you. Information is readily available on the internet about deadlines for this, but usually you have to send a letter postmarked 5 days in advance of your court date stating you want trial by declaration.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can find this information online and I suggest you do it well in advance before you send the actual letter. The letter will read something like “I would like trial by written declaration and include the citation number.” Again this buys you more time. What will happen is that the court will process your request and send you the appropriate forms to fill out. It takes a while for them to do this, it took over a month before I got my papers. Some counties might provide the ability to start the process from online. That is up to you. I personally would opt for typing a letter and mailing it. The more time you can buy the better.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;once-you-receive-the-papers&quot;&gt;Once you receive the papers&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Construct your case as precisely as possible.&lt;/strong&gt; Include all the details you can. Your letter must be revised a few times to prevent contradictions or inaccuracies. Have some of your friends or peers revise it if you like.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structure:&lt;/strong&gt; Make sure the wording is formal and that the events are in order. Start out by describing where you were driving, time of day, weather, how fast you were going etc. Followed by where you were being pulled over, speed, lanes. The conversation and then your reasons why feel the ticket is unjust.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diagrams:&lt;/strong&gt; Include diagrams if you can. Even a hand drawn one. It helps&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deadline:&lt;/strong&gt; Send it by the deadline stated on the papers. Time extension is very important.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wait&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt; Results will of course either be in your favor or against. If you lose you usually have the option to have an in person trial, or at this point just deal with the fine. Which of course you won’t becuase that’s why you’re reading this.
I know this sounds like a lot of work, but it really only took me an hour or two to type a letter and make a diagram for it. I did a bit of additional research, but most of the information is here for you already. You’ll save hundreds of dollars and points on your driver’s license PLUS having to go and pay for traffic school. It was definitely worth the time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/uGaaq.png&quot;&gt;Here’s a link to a sample written declaration&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now to be clear you could win the case with a trial by declaration, which happens maybe 30% of the time, and that would be the end of it, and nothing more needs to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IF YOU LOSE THE TRIAL BY DECLARATION:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s time for shit to get real and go to trial in person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;court&quot;&gt;Court:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scheduling the court date:&lt;/strong&gt; They will set a court date for you. First thing you should do is call the dispatch office where your officer is stationed (written on your ticket) ask for the officer’s schedule (this is considered on the /public record and legally must be disclosed). If the officer has 2 or 3 consecutive days off schedule your court date in the middle or just make sure to schedule your court hearing &lt;strong&gt;on his day off&lt;/strong&gt;. Here’s why: typically officers will set up all their court dates consecutively in one day. If you’re the single ticket interrupting his weekend he’s probably not likely to show up to court.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Here’s why: typically officers will set up all their court dates consecutively in one day so they don’t have to make multiple trips. If you’re the single ticket interrupting his weekend he’s probably not likely to show up to court. Also remember, you’ve pushed this court date for quite a while. Many officers won’t bother showing up for what is now almost a 60 day old ticket. If you’d like to go to trial (again, remember nothing is lost by doing this, at worst you end up right where you started having to pay the fine.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coming to court:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;DRESS NICELY&lt;/strong&gt; and show up &lt;strong&gt;early&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;DO NOT&lt;/strong&gt; use your phone or look down at it in court, just sit and relax. A lot of the folks you’ll be sitting with (other alleged offenders) will come in looking just TERRIBLE. If a judge sees that you’re well dressed, calm, respectful and have been sitting in court for a little while patiently observing and paying attention; you will stand out. Most judges and cops really respect people who respect the process. Eventually your name will be called for your case.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BE RESPECTFUL OF THE JUDGE&lt;/strong&gt;. I have found that by sitting in the front row, dressing nicely, sitting up straight, crossing one leg and sitting professionally and actually making eye contact with the judge as if you’re paying attention makes a world of difference. Saying “Good morning your honor” and ending every sentence with “your honor” makes a &lt;strong&gt;HUGE&lt;/strong&gt; difference every time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evidence:&lt;/strong&gt; You should ask for the radar model number, and radar gun certificate. This certificate should include the last time it was calibrated. This must be done daily on every gun used in a police car, and signed off by a superior. In reality most officers do not have this in court or actually do this. Make sure to ask if the officer used Lidar or Radar to gauge your speed. Radar is less accurate so you might be able to get off a ticket if you just say there was a lot of traffic around you, like big trucks, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A note on speed detection tools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is where you should ask for the radar model number, and radar gun certificate. This certificate should include the last time it was calibrated. (also: Remember to ask if the officer used Lidar or Radar to gauge your speed. Radar (radio waves) is less accurate than LIDAR (pulses of light emitted at regular intervals) so you might be able to get off a ticket if you just say there was a lot of traffic around you, like big trucks, etc. causing an innacurate radar measurement. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lasertech.com/blogs/Traffic-Safety/post/2013/05/15/Difference-Between-Radar-and-Lidar-Explained.aspx&quot;&gt;You can find more information on radar and lidar here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confronting your accuser:&lt;/strong&gt; It is important to point out that when in court the officer is acting as &lt;strong&gt;a witness&lt;/strong&gt;. If he does not show, sometimes they have a proxy cop show up to read his notes on the stand. If either happens, challenge the court based on &lt;strong&gt;INDIVIDUAL RECOLLECTION&lt;/strong&gt;. Any “witness” who will be allowed to be cross referenced is required to be able to specifically remember the event. Ask questions not on the notes and police report. What color is the car? What about the replacement fender? What were you wearing? If you’ve pushed the date out and if he can’t remember, challenge that. You’ve delayed the trial so far back and the officer has definitely forgotten all about this by now, assuming he’s even bothered to show up for a 3 month old random speeding ticket on his day off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully at some point in this process your ticket is either dismissed or the judge offers you a plea deal of some sort. Either way it means that this process was definitely worth the time and I’m sure you learned something along the way. Unfortunately you still have to pay court costs, but those are certainly trivial compared to being found guilty of a &lt;em&gt;crime&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;good-luck&quot;&gt;Good luck!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can remember all of this and I’m sure you’ll be able to fight your average run of the mill speeding ticket and other offenses.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;note: this blog post is about a pretty much random piece of number theory that had gone unsolved for over 300 years, but I will admit that it’s not that exciting for regular people. Especially this one, where I’m pretty much just stealing a wikipedia article because I found it interesting. It’s my blog I do what I want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fermat’s Last Theorem&lt;/strong&gt; states that no three positive integers $a$, $b$, and $c$ satisfy the equation $a^{n} + b^{n} = c^{n}$ for any integer value of $n$ greater than $2$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The cases $n = 1$ and $n = 2$ have been known to have infinitely many solutions and fermat specifically pointed that out when he gave us what little information he did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-story&quot;&gt;The Story&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pierre de Fermat was a prominent french lawyer and mathematician. He used to keep a book of different ideas in math at the time and would scribble in the proofs on the edges of the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fermat’s last theorem has a very interesting story. He was sitting at home alone one day by the fire sipping wine and eating cheese; reading everyone’s favorite math classic novella, The 1670 edition of Diophantus’ Arithmetica. This book contained a lot of the mathematical conjectures and theories that were believed at the time. He was reading this book and proving the conjectures within the margins of the pages!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the last theorems in the book was the one above, he had written that it &lt;strong&gt;could&lt;/strong&gt; be proven, but that there wasn’t enough space in the margins of the pages at the time. (a terrible shame) So he never actually wrote down the proof; and unfortunately passwed away before writing it. Pierre de Fermat died aged 57 or 58, on January 12, 1665 in Castres, France. The cause of his death is not known. Three days before his death, he had been carrying out legal business in the local courthouse. He was buried in the Church of St. Dominique in Castres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-problem&quot;&gt;The problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now this left us with a pretty difficult problem, all of the other proofs in the book were correct, so we had reason to believe that this theorem was also true, but we had no way to prove it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This set the math community ablaze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the special case $n = 4$ proved by Fermat himself, it suffices to prove the theorem for exponents $n$ that are prime numbers (this reduction is considered trivial to prove, mostly by angry math professors). Over the next &lt;strong&gt;two centuries&lt;/strong&gt; (1637–1839), the conjecture was proved for only the primes $3$, $5$, and $7$, although &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Germain%27s_theorem&quot;&gt;Sophie Germain innovated and proved an approach that was relevant to an entire class of primes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_Kummer&quot;&gt;Ernst Kummer&lt;/a&gt; extended this and proved the theorem for &lt;em&gt;all regular primes&lt;/em&gt;, leaving irregular primes to be analyzed individually. Building on Kummer’s work and using sophisticated computer studies (probably a big for loop tbh), other mathematicians were able to extend the proof to cover all prime exponents up to &lt;em&gt;four million&lt;/em&gt;, but a proof for all exponents was inaccessible (meaning that it was either impossible, exceedingly difficult, or unachievable with current knowledge).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-mystery-intensifies&quot;&gt;The mystery intensifies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entirely separately, around 1955, Japanese mathematicians Goro Shimura and Yutaka Taniyama suspected a link might exist between elliptic curves and modular forms, two completely different areas of mathematics. Known at the time as the Taniyama–Shimura-Weil conjecture, and (eventually) as the modularity theorem, it stood on its own, with no apparent connection to Fermat’s Last Theorem. It was widely seen as significant and important in its own right, but was (like Fermat’s theorem) widely considered completely inaccessible to proof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-last-guy-that-would-be-tortured-by-this-french-troll&quot;&gt;The last guy that would be tortured by this french troll.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter Andrew Wiles, he grew up with a childhood fascination with Fermat’s theorem (not a fun childhood in the opinion of this author). He had a background of working with elliptic curves and related fields, decided to try to prove the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture as a way to prove Fermat’s Last Theorem. In 1993, after &lt;strong&gt;six years working in secrecy&lt;/strong&gt; on the problem, Wiles succeeded in proving enough of the conjecture to prove Fermat’s Last Theorem. Wiles’s paper was massive in size and scope. A flaw was discovered in one part of his original paper during peer review and required a further year and collaboration with a past student, Richard Taylor, to resolve. For his proof, Wiles received the 2016 Abel Prize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To imagine dedicating your life to solving a problem, spending six years in secrecy only to have an error pointed out when publsihing the solution. When he discovered the missing piece and complete the proof after an additional year must have been incredible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;cd-testimonials-wrapper&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
        &quot;I was sitting at my desk examining the Kolyvagin–Flach method. It wasn’t that I believed I could make it work, but I thought that at least I could explain why it didn’t work. Suddenly I had this incredible revelation. I realised that, the Kolyvagin–Flach method wasn’t working, but it was all I needed to make my original Iwasawa theory work from three years earlier. So out of the ashes of Kolyvagin–Flach seemed to rise the true answer to the problem. It was so indescribably beautiful; it was so simple and so elegant. I couldn’t understand how I’d missed it and I just stared at it in disbelief for twenty minutes. Then during the day I walked around the department, and I’d keep coming back to my desk looking to see if it was still there. It was still there. I couldn’t contain myself, I was so excited. It was the most important moment of my working life. Nothing I **ever do again** will mean as much.&quot;
      &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the small but fun story of Fermat’s last theorem, formally proven and published in 1995, 358 years after it was first conceived; due to the dedication of Andrew Wiles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;note: Like I said, I didn’t have much to go on when it came to the second blog post I promised, but here it is. I hope the story behind this fun thing was relatively interesting, I didn’t have the time or the background to go into the proof here, but you can find the linked paper below. (it’s over 100 pages so have fun.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We say all the time that we know things. I know that my friend owns a car, &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that $2 + 2 = 4$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I should just say now that if you think that question of knowledge is uninteresting the blog post will not get any better for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are those two pieces of information both knowledge?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are both statements about something that we as people might say that we know, but is there a &lt;em&gt;difference&lt;/em&gt; between those two types of knowledge?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally during these blog post, we try to take the time to define a bunch of concepts in order to know exactly what we’re dealing with in order to then make some intresting conclusions based oin the consequences of those definitions. The only problem here is that humanity currently doesn’t have a good definition for the word “knowledge”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-does-it-mean-to-know-something-1&quot;&gt;What does it mean to &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; something?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we say that we &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; something, most people have a shared and unspoken understanding of what that really means. This blog post is going to attempt to determine what that sentence really means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much earlier people used to regard &lt;em&gt;knowing something&lt;/em&gt; as having a true justified belief in that thing. Let’s roll with that for a bit.
While we go through this I’ll try to justify how this came to be our definition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be more formal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$p$ is true&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$S$ believes that $p$&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$S$ is justified in believing that $p$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-truth-condition&quot;&gt;The truth condition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems kind of obvious in a way, but most people seem to agree that you can’t &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; something that’s false. You can’t say “I know $2 + 2 = 5$ because that’s just not true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something’s truth does not require that anyone can know or prove that it is true. Not all truths are “established” truths. If you flip a coin and never check how it landed, it may be true that it landed heads, even if nobody has any way to tell. Truth is a matter of how things are, not how they can be &lt;em&gt;shown to be&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when we say that only true things can be known, we’re not saying anything about how anyone can &lt;em&gt;access&lt;/em&gt; the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-belief-condition&quot;&gt;The belief condition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;commentable-area&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p data-section-id=&quot;1&quot; class=&quot;commentable-section&quot;&gt;
    The idea here is that you can only know what you believe.
  &lt;/p&gt;

Although initially it might seem obvious that knowing that &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; requires believing that &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;, a few philosophers have argued that knowledge without belief is indeed possible.

  &lt;p data-section-id=&quot;2&quot; class=&quot;commentable-section&quot;&gt;
    Take this example suggested by Colin Radford (1966). Suppose Albert is quizzed on English history. One of the questions is: &lt;strong&gt;“When did Queen Elizabeth die?”&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    Albert doesn’t &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; he knows, but answers the question correctly. Moreover, he gives correct answers to many other questions to which he didn’t think he knew the answer. Let us focus on Albert’s answer to the question about Elizabeth:
  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$E$ :  “Elizabeth died in 1603.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well &lt;em&gt;this is weird&lt;/em&gt;, Albert here is making an assertion about truth, without in fact believing that it’s correct, even though it turned out to be that he was right! Surely Albert doesn’t really &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; that’s when Queen Elizabeth died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;radford-makes-the-following-two-claims-about-this-example&quot;&gt;Radford makes the following two claims about this example:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Albert does not believe $E$&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Albert knows $E$&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Albert’s correct answer is not an expression of knowledge, perhaps because, given his subjective position, he does not have &lt;strong&gt;justification&lt;/strong&gt; for believing $E$; he remembered an answer that happened to be correct. The &lt;em&gt;justification condition&lt;/em&gt; is a key component of someone knowing something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;note: you could also argue that albert perhaps does believe $E$ but that feels like a weaker objection to me personally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-justified-belief-condition&quot;&gt;The justified belief condition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why must a belief by justified? While we should always be able to justify our beliefs, Albert doens’t have a justification for believing the answer he gives in our previous example. He simply gives one that he remembers that happens to be correct in the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, something could be a justified belief at one time and not justified the next. My favorite example of this is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolaus_Copernicus&quot;&gt;Copernicus&lt;/a&gt;. He wrote (not the first) a very famous paper about the nature of the earth in the universe. Before that discovery was made, you may have been justified in believing that the earth was the center of the universe, but the NEXT DAY you wouldn’t have been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is problematic though, because right now we have lots of theories about light, matter, math, chemistry and science but we can never &lt;em&gt;truly be sure&lt;/em&gt; if the things that we currently believe are things that we know because we could potentially continue to discover new things in the future and find that by definition we didn’t know the things we thought we knew before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone could believe they knew that the earth was flat their whole lives and have justification for that belief (check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tfes.org/&quot;&gt;flat earth society&lt;/a&gt;) and if it was scientifically justifiable than they should be able to say that they &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; the earth was flat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise we could go our whole lives without ever really being able to “know” anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;this-is-how-weve-ended-up-at-the-definition-of-justified-true-belief&quot;&gt;This is how we’ve ended up at the definition of “Justified True Belief”.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;heres-why-that-doesnt-work&quot;&gt;Here’s Why that doesn’t work.&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone was generally pretty happy with making statements about knowledge being true justified belief until we found that it didn’t cover conjunctive statements&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter Edmund Gettier, a wonderful philosopher who’s published one of the shortest papers ever (literally two pages). He gives two great examples disproving the idea of knowledge we’ve been building up so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re going to talk more about the second one because I think it’s more useful and a more powerful example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;totally-unnecessary-backstory&quot;&gt;totally unnecessary backstory&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine two people, Smith and Jones, they’re both subpar accountants at an accounting firm in Boston. They’ve worked together at the same firm for a few years. Smith thinks that Jones has ridiculous views about modern architecture but other than that they respect each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us suppose that Smith has strong evidence for the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$f$: Jones owns a Ford.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing crazy there, you’d definitely be justified in believing that someone owned a car if you saw them using it to drive to work every day for a few years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To be more formal:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Smith’s evidence might be that Jones has at all times in the past within
Smith’s memory owned a car, and always a Ford, and that Jones has
just offered Smith a ride while driving a Ford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now imagine that Smith has another friend, Brown, (wow look at Mr. Popular over here. TWO FRIENDS.) who likes to travel. Smith doesn’t know anything about where brown might be on any given day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say Smith selects three places at random, and constructs the following three propositions :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$g$: Either Jones owns a Ford, or Brown is in Boston;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$h$: Either Jones owns a Ford, or Brown is in Barcelona;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;$i$: Either Jones owns a Ford, or Brown is in Brest-Litovsk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First thing you might notice is that each of these propositions is entailed by $f$ which we talked about before. Smith is therefore completely justified in believing each of these three propositions. Smith, of course, has no idea where Brown is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;now-lets-say-we-find-out-two-new-pieces-of-information&quot;&gt;Now let’s say we find out two new pieces of information.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Jones does not own a Ford, but is at present driving a rented car.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Brown happens to be in Barcelona, making $h$ true.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an instance in which, proposition $h$ is true, but it doesn’t satisfy our definition of knowledge. This is because the part of the statement that makes it a &lt;em&gt;justified&lt;/em&gt; belief is separated from the part of the statement that actually makes it &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;-shit&quot;&gt;… shit.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper was a huge deal because for a while people thought this problem was pretty much dealt with. But now we’ve got to deal with this kind of a problem, these &lt;em&gt;Gettier cases&lt;/em&gt; in which an assertion about the world can be justified by an ultimately false belief that simply &lt;em&gt;happen to be true&lt;/em&gt; due to things unknown to those making the assertion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it’s worth saying that Philosophy hasn’t come to an actual consensus on this issue! There are some crazy examples about dogs in a field and organized criminals setting up barn facades but we’re going to talk a little bit about one particular way to deal with the problem which is to add a new condition to the True Justified Belief conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Safety : In all nearby worlds where $S$ believes that $p$, $p$ is not false.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The notion of safety here is one that describes how similar the state of affairs could be while still having the same result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a “nearby” world, Brown might have gone to Costa Rica instead (classic Brown). Our &lt;em&gt;TJSB&lt;/em&gt; definition of knowledge enables us to not include this statement as knowledge because in &lt;em&gt;nearby&lt;/em&gt; possible worlds Brown could have went anywhere, and $h$ is not going to be true in those &lt;em&gt;nearby&lt;/em&gt; possible worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;if you’re still reading …  thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this seems to be a pretty close to concrete definition of knowledge that does work for a lot of cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a refutation worth exploring that comes from &lt;a href=&quot;http://comesana.arizona.edu//publications&quot;&gt;Juan Comesaña&lt;/a&gt; who published this in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a little unfair to say the matter is resolved given the vagueness of the “nearby” condition. In Comesaña’s example, the host of a Halloween party enlists Judy to direct guests to the party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judy’s instructions are to give everyone directions, but that if she sees Michael, the party will be moved to another location. (The host does not want Michael to find the party.) Suppose she never sees Michael, but some other person decides to wear the same costume that Michael was going to, then his belief on what the directions are, &lt;em&gt;justified&lt;/em&gt; and based in Judy’s testimony, about the whereabouts of the party will be &lt;strong&gt;true&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comesaña says they could easily have been false. (Had he merely made a slightly different choice about his costume, he would have been mistaken as Michael and deceived.) Comesaña describes the case as a counterexample to the safety condition on knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea here being that in a nearby world in which this guest wore a similar costume, he could be given a different justified true belief (the directions to the party) but that would not be knowledge because $p$ could in fact be false in a “nearby” world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is open to a safety theorist to argue that the relevant skeptical scenario, though possible and in some sense nearby, is not near enough in the relevant respect to falsify the safety condition. Such a theorist would, if she wanted the safety condition to deliver clear verdicts, face the task of articulating just what the relevant notion of similarity amounts to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re now pretty much at the modern day, we haven’t achieved perfect consensus but it’s certainly really interesting to contemplate what it means to know something!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today we’re going to get into a small discussion about whether the soul is a part of you. Meaning; is your soul something that’s necessarily a physical part of you as a person?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be more specific, this is an argument that was posed to posit the existence of the concept of “a soul” as an explanation for the phenomenon of human free will.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;cd-testimonials-wrapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;u&gt;Note:&lt;/u&gt; If you have strong religious views on what the soul is and don’t enjoy questioning them, you may not enjoy reading this post. That being said, this post is not written to convince you of a particular point of view, but simply inform you about an interesting argument about the philosophical debate on the nature of the immaterial soul.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;laying-the-groundwork&quot;&gt;Laying the Groundwork&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So before we can have this conversation, it may be useful to set a context for it. First, we have to talk about a couple of views about what people are before we can posit an argument in favor of one case or the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two prevailing views on this issue, there’s the dualist view, that a person is comprised of a body and a soul. Then there’s the physicalist view that a person is just a body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these views have interesting consequences, and the argument we’re going to discuss comes from the dualist perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to define an important concept, the idea that a system can be deterministic. Meaning that if you reproduce an identical system multiple times, that a predictable outcome can be observed that follows specific rules. Most of physics uses determinism to predict how a system will unfold all the time. To quote google:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;cd-testimonials-wrapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
  de·ter·min·ism (noun)
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    /dəˈtərməˌnizəm/
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
  The doctrine that all events, including human action, are ultimately determined by causes external to the will. Some philosophers have taken determinism to imply that individual human beings have no free will and cannot be held morally responsible for their actions.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s define another concept really quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;cd-testimonials-wrapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    Free Will: the idea that if I am put into the exact same situation multiple times, I could make a different decision each time. There is nothing necessarily consistent about the actions of a being with free will.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So without further ado, the argument is the following.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;there-are-three-premises&quot;&gt;There are three premises:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Humans have free will.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Nothing subject to determinism has free will.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;All purely physical systems are subject to determinism.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion-therefore-humans-are-not-purely-physical-systems&quot;&gt;Conclusion: Therefore, humans are not purely physical systems.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to explain the concept of free will we appeal to the idea of a soul, something non-physical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-should-we-evaluate-this-argument&quot;&gt;How should we evaluate this argument?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the first question that I asked when I heard this was “What is it about free will that proves that we’re not purely physical objects?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would there be an incompatibility between the idea of having free will and the idea of things being determined?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we’ll start our analysis with a couple of important questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;is-this-argument-valid&quot;&gt;Is this argument valid?&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first question we should ask is, “does our argument make sense?” Does this argument’s conclusions truly logically follow?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’ll save you some time and tell you that it’s conclusion does follow. Given these particular assumptions, it makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;are-our-assumptions-valid&quot;&gt;Are our assumptions valid?&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you realize it or not, this argument uses some serious assumptions, that we should be more rigorous about defining before we accept this radical conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;premise one&lt;/strong&gt;: This argument rests on the idea of free will. The idea that if we have free will we can’t just be purely physical systems. I think the strongest objection that someone could give would be that we don’t truly have free will. We might certainly believe we do; but free will isn’t something that can be observed. Perhaps the sense that we could have acted otherwise is an illusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;premise three&lt;/strong&gt;: “All purely physical systems are subject to determinism.” The statement asserts we can’t have free will and determinism. 3 is a pretty serious claim about empirical science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantum mechanics as an example is certainly not deterministic. We can observe particles that might be found in one position $60%$ of the time; without knowing&lt;em&gt;_ why_&lt;/em&gt; they behave the way that they do. &lt;em&gt;Determinism is not true&lt;/em&gt; at the level of quantum mechanics. This leads me to say that premise three might be &lt;em&gt;false&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should say that premise two can be challenged as well and I’d encourage you to think about why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’ve told you the argument, I’ve told you what I think, let me know what you think~&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;souls-are--weird&quot;&gt;Souls are … weird.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/public/img/3d_1.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&quot;the-liberator-a-3d-printed-handgun&quot;&gt;The liberator, a 3D printed handgun&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you’re looking at above is an image of one of the very first 3D printed weapons ever designed and distributed for free on the internet. To think that you could go on the internet and mass produce a gun or a rifle in your own home by printing them. This would have been unheard of even in 2012. So what’s really changed in the past couple of years?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot to understand here; so let’s start with the basics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is 3D printing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if you already know about 3D printing, feel free to skip ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3D printing is the ability to use special printers that layer plastics in order to create 3 dimensional objects. This has become a popular phenomenon in the tech community enabling a new and exciting avenue for creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;warning-history-incoming&quot;&gt;Warning: history incoming:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The earliest 3D printing technologies first became visible in the late 1980’s, at which time they were called Rapid Prototyping (RP) technologies. This is because the processes were originally conceived as a fast and more cost-effective method for creating prototypes for product development within industry. As an interesting aside, the very first patent application for RP technology was filed by a “Dr Kodama”, in Japan, in May 1980. Later, 3D Systems’ first commercial RP system, the SLA-1, was introduced in 1987 and following rigorous testing the first of these system was sold in 1988. 2007 was the year the shoots started to show through and this embryonic, open source 3D printing movement started to gain visibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But it wasn’t until January 2009 that the first commercially available and affordable 3D printer — in kit form and based on the RepRap concept — was offered for sale. This was the BfB RapMan 3D printer. Closely followed by Makerbot Industries in April the same year, the founders of which were heavily involved in the development of RepRap until they departed from the Open Source philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-it-works&quot;&gt;How it works…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common type of 3D printing is the process called &lt;strong&gt;Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM)&lt;/strong&gt;, and this technology is the primary method used to makenot just the &lt;a href=&quot;https://3dprint.com/14636/3d-prnted-guns/&quot;&gt;handful of working 3D printed guns&lt;/a&gt; that have been made, but almost all 3D printing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/public/img/3d_2.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&quot;yoda-being-3d-printed-in-layers&quot;&gt;Yoda being 3D printed in layers&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process works by slicing a digital file containing the 3D model into dozens, sometimes hundreds of (usually) 0.1 mm thick layers. The 3D printer will then use robotic precision to replicate each of these individual slices on a printing bed using melted thermoplastics, one layer printed on top of another. The result, hopefully, will be a complete physical copy of the digital file. Depending on the size of the part, the type of material being used and the model of 3D printer, this process can take several hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did 3D weapons come to exist?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our story begins where most violence happens, Little rock, Arkansas. In the Summer of 2012 Ben Denio and Cody Wilson sought to create a political and legal vehicle for demonstrating and promoting the subversive potential of /publicly-available 3D Printing technologies. They called this venture “&lt;strong&gt;Defense Distributed&lt;/strong&gt;”. On July 27th, 2012 they launched the Wiki Weapon Project- the effort to create and release the files for &lt;strong&gt;the world’s first printable handgun&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August a month later, Indiegogo.com removed DD’s inaugural fundraising campaign from its website, citing a terms of service violation. This removal prompted a backlash in the tech community, and the Bitcoin community helped fund the Wiki Weapon. By September 2012, DD had raised enough money to start prototyping and experimentation, when industry player Stratasys (a popular manufacturer of 3D printers) scandalously revoked its lease with the company and quickly repossessed its printer. This repossession, one of the first of its kind, made world news, and the Wiki Weapon found even more support. Research and development continued. . .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/public/img/3d_3.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;the-liberator-parts-printed-and-disassembled&quot;&gt;The liberator parts printed and disassembled.&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;this-is-the-liberator&quot;&gt;This, is the liberator.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These components are the brainchild of Defense Distributed’s vision of open sourced weapons available for the /public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the liberator was published, it did so as an open source software package, containing cad (computer-aided design) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_%28file_format%29&quot;&gt;.stl files&lt;/a&gt; that would allow you to print the individually designed components from your own home and reproduce the pistol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was interesting. This should be protected by both the First Amendment, since it involves expression of written information, and the Second (I’m thinking about the 2008 Heller decision) — It &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; like it should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;except-that-it-wasnt-justice&quot;&gt;Except that it wasn’t. #Justice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A letter was sent&lt;/strong&gt; from the federal government addressed to Wilson and Defense Distributed, It was signed by Glenn Smith, chief of enforcement for the State Department’s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, Office of Defense Trade Control Compliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smith warned Wilson that the technical specs he made /publicly available may be “&lt;strong&gt;ITAR-controlled technical data&lt;/strong&gt;” released “without the required prior authorization” from the State Department. &lt;strong&gt;ITAR&lt;/strong&gt; stands for International Traffic in Arms Regulations, which are the U.S. government’s set of rules controlling the import and export of munitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, by releasing CAD files allowing anyone with access to a 3D printer to make a somewhat fragile plastic pistol, Wilson may have become an illegal arms trafficker. The State Department didn’t say for sure that this information (some might call it &lt;em&gt;speech&lt;/em&gt;) fell under its jurisdiction. But while regulators pondered the question-and four months later, at press time, they were still pondering-they demanded that Wilson “treat the above technical data as ITAR-controlled,” meaning that “all such data should be removed from /public access immediately.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 3em&quot;&gt;So&lt;/span&gt; what we’re essentially seeing is that sharing code that can create guns is considered the same thing as exporting guns? That’s weird.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waiting on the issue for a bit, Defense distributed decided they were going to take matters into their own hands and sue the federal government for the right to distribute files online pursuant to their constitutional right to free speech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;in-a-very-interesting-but-completely-unsurprising-ruling-the-courts-ruled-against-defense-distributed&quot;&gt;In a very interesting (but completely unsurprising) ruling; the courts ruled against Defense Distributed.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You can read the original court documents relating to the appeal &lt;a href=&quot;https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3111635/15-50759-Documents.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Ordinarily, of course, the protection of constitutional rights would be the highest /public interest at issue in a case. That is not necessarily true here, however, because the State Department has asserted a very strong /public interest in national defense and national security. Indeed, the State Department’s stated interest in preventing foreign nationals — including all manner of enemies of this country — from obtaining technical data on how to produce weapons and weapon parts is not merely tangentially related to national defense and national security; it lies squarely within that interest.” — Defense distributed V. Department of State¹&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However it should be noted that there was not consensus as it was a 2–1 decision. Here is a statement from 5th Circuit, District Judge Edith Jones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“In sum, it is not at all clear that the State Department has any concern for the First Amendment rights of the American /public and press. Indeed, the State Department turns freedom of speech on its head by asserting, “The possibility that an Internet site could also be used to distribute the technical data domestically does not alter the analysis….” The Government bears the burden to show that its regulation is narrowly tailored to suit a compelling interest. It is not the /public’s burden to prove their right to discuss lawful, non-classified, non-restricted technical data.” — Defense distributed V. Department of State²&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;where-are-we-now&quot;&gt;Where are we now?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested, the liberator’s original source files can &lt;a href=&quot;https://kat.cr/defdist-defcad-mega-pack-v4-4-raiden-t7531415.html&quot;&gt;still be found on torrent sites.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;del&gt;Also, Defense Distributed has an interesting Instagram page so if you’re interested you can see the research and development that they do.&lt;/del&gt;
Edit: They have since removed the instagram page; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/defdist?lang=en&quot;&gt;here’s their twitter though&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;here-are-some-questions-i-dont-have-the-answers-to-yet-but-am-curious-about-learning-jump-into-the-comments-if-youre-interested&quot;&gt;Here are some questions I don’t have the answers to yet but am curious about learning. Jump into the comments if you’re interested.&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DD was not allowed to publish the liberator files due to the fear that foreign nationals might be able to obtain them, making DD an illegal arms trafficker. What would happen if the software in question continued to be leaked unto torrent sites due to being “hacked” by strangers that DD had no control over? Would they still be responsible for the files being shared on the internet?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Should the GNU GPL be revised in order to remove liability for any harm caused by GPL licensed source files that are open sourced weapons?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: 3em&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;ake a look at this paper. It’s titled, “Deep learning and the Schrödinger equation”. It’s implications are really interesting; first let’s take a look at the paper’s claim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“We have trained a deep (convolutional) neural network to predict the ground-state energy of an electron in four classes of confining two-dimensional electrostatic potentials. On randomly generated potentials, for which there is no analytic form for either the potential or the ground-state energy, the neural network model was able to predict the ground-state energy to within chemical accuracy, with a &lt;strong&gt;median absolute error of 1.49 mHa&lt;/strong&gt;. We also investigate the performance of the model in predicting other quantities such as the kinetic energy and the first excited-state energy of random potentials. While we demonstrated this approach on a simple, tractable problem, &lt;strong&gt;the transferability and excellent performance of the resulting model suggests further applications of deep neural networks to problems of electronic structure.&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does this mean in laymen’s terms? It basically means that we can give a computer a lot of different examples of any given problem we want it to solve and can get answers for questions about that problem that are &lt;strong&gt;really accurate&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you were looking at some physical phenomenon you wanted to understand. (Let’s use something like the probability of finding a tennis ball that you dropped in a hole in the ground.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now in general if you drop a tennis ball in a big hole in the ground it usually falls towards the center where the hole is the deepest. So it’s unlikely that it will get caught on the outer fringes, but still possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you might get some sort of curve of changing probability that looks like this, where x=0 is the center of the hole and the further out you go, the lower the probability gets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/public/img/ml_1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;commentable-area&quot;&gt;

&lt;h6&gt; ratchet probability example of how likely you are to find a tennis ball.&lt;/h6&gt;

  &lt;p data-section-id=&quot;1&quot; class=&quot;commentable-section&quot;&gt;
    Now imagine instead of a tennis ball, you’re looking at an electron, and instead of gravity acting on the tennis ball, it’s now electric potentials that create coulomb forces on that electron that force it into a certain position.
  &lt;/p&gt;

This situation I’ve just described is called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_in_a_box&quot;&gt;quantum well&lt;/a&gt;; something you’ll see a lot in an introductory quantum mechanics course. The usefulness of the quantum well example is that you usually earn how to model it using the **Schrödinger equation**.

$$ i\hbar {\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}\Psi (\mathbf {r} ,t)=\left[{\frac {-\hbar ^{2}}{2\mu }}\nabla ^{2}+V(\mathbf {r} ,t)\right]\Psi (\mathbf {r} ,t) $$

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read more about the Schrödinger equation &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but for our purposes what you should know is that it gets very complicated very quickly. The second you start trying to use it to model two tennis balls, things become very very difficult to solve, especially because we only have the probabilities!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-glass-box&quot;&gt;The glass box&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we manipulate equations that we believe accurately model the real world, every valid manipulation of that model is something that we also believe to be “true”, and we continue to manipulate this equation until we arrive at a statement of interest to the question we’re asking. These models are sometimes called a “&lt;strong&gt;glass box&lt;/strong&gt;”. This is because the process we are inspecting is one that we believe that we understand because the model we’re using works for that particular problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of this paper something called a Convolutional Neural Network is used. It works by looking at thousands of input-output examples of the thing you want to model, and creates an approximation of the raw numerical operations that are applied to your input in order to “fake” knowing whatever the function actually is. This process of creating a numerical model that doesn’t have to know anything about the function it’s approximating is called a “&lt;strong&gt;black box&lt;/strong&gt;”. We know what we put into the box and we know what comes out, and that’s it. Because we don’t really know what the model looks like other than the numbers, we usually just test it to see how accurate it is and then use it for problems where we don’t have a glass box yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This concept of neural networks was actually invented in the 1950’s, but it’s only recently that this method of machine learning has exploded in popularity for solving complex problems. This paper is interesting because it enables us to use computers as black boxes to solve problems that were once thought to only be solved with glass boxes. Now we don’t need to understand a problem in order to be able to use an approximation of the answer. And before you say it, this has nothing to do with the hidden variables theory, which isn’t what we’re talking about. (That’s a question that Einstein)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;cd-testimonials-wrapper&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
        Now we don’t need to understand a problem in order to be able to use an approximation of the answer.
      &lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;/ul&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;which-models-are-better&quot;&gt;Which models are better?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well just looking at it heuristically we get exact accuracy with glass boxes but they can take a long time to develop and accurately research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand we can get black boxes that can give us a 0.1% margin of error and provide us with models for a lot of different problems a LOT faster because all we have to do is collect some data and then train a machine learning algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That brings up a more important question for us then, what’s more important? &lt;strong&gt;Is numerical accuracy all that matters? What is a model supposed to do for us?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the answer is that the model we choose in general entirely depends on the problem. Up until recently we’ve never really had the option to use anything other than a pure math, glass box solution to model any given situation to the best of our ability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to state though that this does have it’s limits. The predictions of these machine learning models are based solely upon our experimental data. So if there are unusual qualities we don’t know about, we won’t be able to notice until we hit edge cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet_catastrophe&quot;&gt;ultraviolet catastrophe&lt;/a&gt; was a fault in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh%E2%80%93Jeans_law&quot;&gt;Rayleigh-Jeans law&lt;/a&gt; that was only uncovered because we could use test the model on much smaller wavelengths that we hadn’t used in experiment to see what it would predict. Only then did we find that it was unrealistic and needed to be revised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how should we model reality? Do we need to understand how a particular phenomenon works in order to make meaningful use of our predictions? Or can we ignore it and go on to use machine learning to speed up research and engineering at the cost of understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Engineer in my says who cares, but the physicist in me cares quite a lot and believes that there shouldn’t be a black box in our understanding of fundamental aspects of reality like schrodinger evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-what-did-you-just-read&quot;&gt;So what did you just read?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-disclaimer-thats-what&quot;&gt;A disclaimer that’s what.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 3em&quot;&gt;Y&lt;/span&gt;ou probably have seen something like this before. The idea of this concept is a poor attempt to shield an entity from any form of legal repercussions as a consequence of emails as well as create consequences if that information ends up being sent to the wrong person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-an-email-disclaimer&quot;&gt;What is an email disclaimer?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start from the ground up with a simple definition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;cd-testimonials-wrapper&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
        dis·claim·er
      &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
        disˈklāmər/
      &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
        noun
      &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
        a statement that denies something, especially responsibility.
      &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
        e.g. “the novel carries the usual disclaimer about the characters bearing no relation to living persons”, “a disclaimer of responsibility”
      &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
        synonyms:denial, refusal, rejection
      &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
        legal — an act of repudiating another’s claim or renouncing one’s own.
      &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;div class=&quot;cd-author&quot;&gt;
				&lt;ul class=&quot;cd-author-info&quot;&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Google.com definition&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when used in the context of an email, I suppose the intention here is to avoid being liable to some sort of consequences that could come from the contents of the email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;history-of-disclaimers&quot;&gt;History of disclaimers:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the younger readers, you may find it interesting that letters were written up and sent in an envelope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that; archaic machines were forged to transmit bits of information over telephone lines in order to send a document to a unique identifying address. You may never have seen one, but this machine was called a fax. They made it really easy for you to simply type in a number in order to send a document to someone by simply knowing the right numbers to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shockingly, this led to a lot of people sending documents to the wrong locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, faxes were often sent to people at hotels, where the fax would be received by a business center and delivered to a hotel room. This led to concerns that the information in the fax might be misdelivered or read by persons for whom it was &lt;strong&gt;not intended&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THAT is how this whole message disclaimer business began. It really makes sense in this context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter the world of the &lt;strong&gt;email&lt;/strong&gt;. Lawyers were sending messages that could contain “legally privileged information” and wanted some sort of similar protection despite it no longer being necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;cd-testimonials-wrapper&quot;&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;
        e·mail — ˈēmāl/
        &lt;br /&gt;
        noun
        &lt;br /&gt;
        messages distributed by electronic means from one computer user to one or more recipients via a network.
      &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;div class=&quot;cd-author&quot;&gt;
				&lt;ul class=&quot;cd-author-info&quot;&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Google.com definition&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, rather than putting the disclaimer at the beginning of an email, by virtue of reasoning I cannot understand, by nearly universal practice the disclaimer is placed at the end of the e-mail. Thus, the unintended recipient would read the entire e-mail, only to discover the frightening language informing him or her of their wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-do-people-use-them-now&quot;&gt;Why do people use them now?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An email disclaimer &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; provide you a few things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;potentially refuse responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;is virtually free to add on to an email.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;does virtually no harm outside of looking a bit silly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it makes sense why they’ve started to see widespread use; but does it actually make sense?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here is an example email disclaimer I received once, take a look and we’ll break it down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This e-mail is intended for the addressee shown. It contains information that is confidential and protected from disclosure. Any review, dissemination or use of this transmission or its contents by persons or unauthorized employees of the intended organisations is strictly prohibited. If you are not the intended recipient please delete this message and notify the sender immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The contents of this email do not necessarily represent the views or policies of &lt;strong&gt;REDACTED&lt;/strong&gt;, its employees or students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;its-roastin-time-grab-your-popcorn-now&quot;&gt;It’s Roastin’ time. Grab your popcorn™ now.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the obvious. You receive an email, and proceed to read it, you get to the bottom of the email and notice this disclaimer. It begins with the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“This e-mail is intended for the addressee shown.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;duh&quot;&gt;duh.&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let’s say this email was actually intended for someone else, how the heck would you know? It was sent to me; the &lt;em&gt;addressee shown&lt;/em&gt;. How does one &lt;em&gt;actually know&lt;/em&gt; if they were the intended recipient when an email is sent to them, the &lt;strong&gt;recipient&lt;/strong&gt;! Are you a mind reader? Would &lt;strong&gt;proof&lt;/strong&gt; need to be shown to a court room that you knew you weren’t the intended recipient at the time of unintended receipt?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“If you are not the intended recipient please delete this message and notify the sender immediately.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And what if I dont?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;oh-no-ive-read-it-exactly-like-i-shouldnt-have-because-the-disclaimer-is-at-the-bottom-of-the-email-despite-being-something-that-should-obviously-be-read-beforehand-what-do-i-do&quot;&gt;Oh no! I’ve read it exactly like I shouldn’t have because the disclaimer is at the bottom of the email despite being something that should obviously be read beforehand! What do I do?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, this is my blog post, I’ll be asking the questions here. Second, keep your voice down, I’m right here; there’s no need to be so loud. Third I am not a lawyer, so take this advice with a grain of salt. No this disclaimer of me talking to you isn’t like those other disclaimers from before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So on the one hand, if I am not the recipient, I am told that I &lt;strong&gt;cannot&lt;/strong&gt; act on information in the message. On the other hand, I am instructed to take particular actions in that case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“It contains information that is confidential and protected from disclosure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;protected-by-what-come-on&quot;&gt;Protected by what?! COME ON!!&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being that there is no statute or law given to provide some context as to why, and it’s only “prohibited” and doesn’t explain the nature of the consequences I can’t say that I’m scared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, If the mail system always adds a disclaimer saying that the message doesn’t represent official policy… &lt;strong&gt;how do you state official policy by email?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;it-is-just-wasting-space&quot;&gt;It is just Wasting space.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine going back and forth for just a few emails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A message posted to a mailing list that contained exactly five lines of real content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;1: greeting
2: blank
3: a quick question, followed by a thank you
4: blank
5: &amp;lt;author’s name&amp;gt;
6: blank
7–23: LEGAL NONSENSE
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a huge waste of space, and feels really stupid if you’ve received something like this. The signal to noise ratio is terrible!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;were-now-getting-to-the-equally-entertaining-but-less-outlandish-and-ridiculous-section-of-the-blog-post-bear-with-me-well-get-through-this-together&quot;&gt;We’re now getting to the equally entertaining, but less outlandish and ridiculous section of the blog post. Bear with me, we’ll get through this together.&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;so-ultimately-does-this-actually-do-anything&quot;&gt;So ultimately does this actually do anything?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, according to The Economist¹, these types of agreements are not legally enforceable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“In the United States, several courts have ruled that email disclaimers may have a legal effect when intentionally included in an email, generally before the text of the email or in the body of the email. However, no court appears to have ruled on the effectiveness of boilerplate email disclaimers appearing below the signature line in every email².”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To cite an actual case that this author happens to find hilarious, let’s take a look at Romero v. Romero³ which pushed the limits of what can be, “disclaimed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One family court case spilled over into an email that stated “pay-back is really a b&lt;em&gt;**&lt;/em&gt;” and that the recipients “still have a gigantic debt to pay to me, which will be paid no matter what.” Romero v. Romero, 2011 Cal. App. Unpub. LEXIS 8706 (Cal. App. 4th Dist. Nov. 14, 2011)³. The e-mail concluded with, “Your most determined, unstoppable, and visceral enemy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below that, the email included the following boilerplate disclaimer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“DISCLAIMER: Not one word herein should be construed by anyone as meaning violent or threatening intentions, and instead the entire contents is to be taken by the strict literary meaning. There have not been, and will be any elucidated threats of violence or intent, either expressed or implied, within the entirety of this document.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unsurprisingly&lt;/strong&gt;, the recipient of the e-mail sought a protective order. The sender claimed his emails were protected by his First Amendment right of free speech and that the “disclaimer” prevented the emails from being used as the basis for a protective order. The court explained to the sender that his documented threat and harassment of the recipient would not be ignored “by simply putting a disclaimer on it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;l-o-l-nah-soncalifornia-district-court&quot;&gt;“L O L, Nah son.” — California District Court.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;suppose-we-ignore-my-previous-citations-and-take-these-disclaimers-at-face-value&quot;&gt;Suppose we ignore my previous citations and take these disclaimers at face value.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be a little paranoid to be using these from a legal perspective anyway. An incredible amount of trust is already given to the internet and the different servers that move your emails across the globe. Yes, we can fight this with PGP encryption and other techniques, but it can only get us so far if a determined third party were to obtain our data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider for a moment sending an overnight mail package: Have you ever read the delivery contract? (I already know you haven’t read the EULA for half of the websites you were on today, let alone one for this site) Most likely, it gives the carrier the absolute right to open the package for almost any reason. How good is the security of that package along the way? Who might be opening your package and reading the contents?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In actual fact, the likelihood of a particular email message being intercepted by a truly interested party is relatively low.

&lt;p&gt;Most of my friends know I’m a big fan of monopoly. I had been saying for a while that there must be an optimal way to play this game that can be modeled by simulating multiple monopoly games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One question that’s worth answering is what spaces are landed on the most?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we’re going to play monopoly like a programmer would. We’ll run a simulation of 100,000 games to model &lt;strong&gt;what spaces a single player is most likely to land on&lt;/strong&gt;. Based on that we’ll know which spaces are the most valuable to purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For the record this is a hideous brute force approach to the problem and there are much more interesting monopoly simulations you can do using markov chains; unfortunately I am not Hannah Fry and cannot simply do these things in a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since it’s a good set of sample data, I’ll show you how to store this data in MongoDB Atlas to make it easy for you when you need real database storage in the future. If you’ve never used MongoDB before, all you need to know is that it’s an Open Source Database that doesn’t use a formal mechanism in order to store data, you simply give mongo the objects and data you want to store and it handles the rest for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;MongoDB Atlas is a database as a service created by the experts who design and engineer MongoDB. It provides all of the features of MongoDB, while removing most of the operational overhead. With MongoDB Atlas you can deliver your applications quickly, and focus on what matters most to you and your customers. ~ &lt;strong&gt;They’ll host a database for you, and do it really well&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without further ado; Let’s get to work!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;running-our-simulation&quot;&gt;Running our Simulation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is my code for running our bare-bones monopoly simulation. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/davidawad/monopoly&quot;&gt;you can find the source here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# models a single monopoly player's Tour around the board multiple Times&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;random&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;shuffle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;randint&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# simulate 10^5 games&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;games&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# average number of turns per game&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;finish&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;35&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# create array of all squares on the board&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;squares&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;40&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;squares&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# a player lands on a space (finish_order * games) times&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some things to note about this simulator:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It doesn’t track money which can affect the number of turns, but is independent of the dice rolls themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It assumes that the average monopoly game takes about 35 turns before a game ends.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It assumes that the “Go To Jail” space is not one that can be landed on, but results in landing on the “Jail” space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This code makes no distinction between “just visiting” jail and “being in” jail. For our purposes the two are functionally the same, as we don’t get anything out of someone being in jail.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;total number of turns&lt;/code&gt; = (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;turns per game&lt;/code&gt; \times &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;number of games played&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So after running our simulator for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;100,000&lt;/code&gt; games what are our stats?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a look at this spreadsheet; we’ve listed the name of each numbered space on the board along with our calculated information. The frequency percentage has been calculated as the number of times landed on a space divided by the total number of turns in the simulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;storing-our-data-in-mongodb&quot;&gt;Storing our data in MongoDB&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for showing off your fancy new data to your friends just in case they don’t believe your conclusions, we’ll store the data in MongoDB Atlas. (Arguably they should learn your conclusions the hard way, but let’s use MongoDB anyway; it’s a great tool for serious data storage and replication and the knowledge will come in handy in the future!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of connecting to the Atlas hosted database is fortunately really simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s two components to this, we &lt;strong&gt;create our database&lt;/strong&gt; in Atlas, and then simply &lt;strong&gt;connect to it&lt;/strong&gt; from another computer or application to store our information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;making-our-database-in-atlas&quot;&gt;Making our database in Atlas&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start by making an account on http://mongodb.com/atlas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve done that, you should get a screen that looks like this with no clusters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/public/img/mongo_3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;screenshot taken from the actual mongodb blog :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go ahead and make your cluster with whatever number instances you want, you can set this up with the lowest tier settings with additional options for more complex setups, but for now we’ll stick with the small stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Note: make a note of the admin username and password as you’ll need them to connect in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/public/img/mongo_4.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
Setting up the mongo cluster&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have your cluster, click the connect button on the top right, and configure your whitelist entry to allow connections from anywhere. Hit confirm and we should be all set!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Note: Even though your database is hosted in the cloud, allowing access from anywhere is incredibly dangerous and you should use more strict rules in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/public/img/mongo_5.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our VERY DANGEROUS security whitelist&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;connecting-for-that-sweet-sweet-data-transfer&quot;&gt;Connecting for that sweet, sweet data transfer&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Note: If you don’t have mongo installed already, you should definitely do a quick &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;brew install mongo&lt;/code&gt; to get it. If you don’t have OSX or brew just &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/&quot;&gt;check out this page&lt;/a&gt; on how to install mongo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you’ve hopefully just installed the Mongo Client. You should be able to run the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mongo&lt;/code&gt; application from the command line. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mongo&lt;/code&gt; is the client program that’s going to do the talking to our actual database, which is &lt;strong&gt;hosted for us&lt;/strong&gt; on the Atlas platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hit the connect button again and take a look through the page; you should see a segment titled; “Connect with the Mongo Shell.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copy the sample connection command that is templated out for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/public/img/mongo_6.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
copy that command; it’s gold!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-sh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mongo “mongodb://cluster01-shard-00–00-vvmfr.mongodb.net:27017,cluster01-shard-00–01-vvmfr.mongodb.net:27017,cluster01-shard-00–02-vvmfr.mongodb.net:27017/admin?replicaSet&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;Cluster01-shard-0” — ssl — username admin — password &amp;lt;YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE&amp;gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;using-the-database&quot;&gt;Using the database&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can see something like the screen above, you now have access to your database cluster!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/public/img/mongo_7.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s do some of the basics! (you can read about more of the mongo shell and what it can do here)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll go on with the basics, at the first mongoDB prompt, you can create a database right from the start, we’ll call ours monopoly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Cluster01&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;shard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;PRIMARY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;use&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;monopoly&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;switched&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;monopoly&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Cluster01&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;shard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;PRIMARY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;_id&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ObjectId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;5886d2d8482270f08c4e44a2&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Mediterranean Avenue&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;68130&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Cluster01&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;shard&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;PRIMARY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll find that this paradigm of choosing a db, selecting a collection and inserting documents into that collection, remains consistent throughout all of the mongo drivers for all of the different programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now you’re all set to do anything with your Mongo powered Monopoly Database. Now please enjoy this completely unaltered photo of a walrus wearing a party hat.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the space that ends up being landed on the most is Jail. What that means for monopoly or capitalism is beyond the scope of this blog, but it is an interesting fact nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The space that collects rent that is landed on the most is New York Avenue! The other orange properties seem to be solid investments probabilistically as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The dark blue properties like Park Place, (or Park Lane in the UK!) are &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the MongoDB Atlas platform has some fantastic features and is incredibly flexible; definitely take a look at mongodb.com if you’re interested in open source database software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post was originally inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hannahfry.co.uk/&quot;&gt;Hannah Fry&lt;/a&gt;. Her latest book, The Indisputable Existence of Santa Claus uses mathematics in a lot of unique and interesting ways. If you found this post interesting; she takes an entirely different approach to the monopoly problem and many others!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want just the technical stuff, skip to the “How” section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what&quot;&gt;What.&lt;/h2&gt;

So if you’ve been on the internet at all you’ve probably heard of a lot of things about Bitcoin. If you google search what bitcoin is right now you’re going to get a pretty comprehensive, but not very approachable definition.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class=&quot;cd-testimonials-wrapper&quot;&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
      /ˈbitˌkoin/
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
      a type of digital currency in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank
      &lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;ul class=&quot;cd-author-info&quot;&gt;

				&lt;/ul&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

So a digital currency is something we’ve seen before. We make payments online everyday through services like PayPal, Venmo, and all sorts of other ACH transactions. What would make bitcoin any different from the money we already use?


To answer this question, we have to identify what we think currency is in the first place.

currency: a system of money in general use in a particular country.

Aha, so currency is something specific to a country and government. A group of people live in the same country and agree that country’s currency has value in exchange for goods and services. That value is then backed by the government, and the currency is regulated by a central bank.

Bitcoin is built without the need for any central authority (decentralized) and built in such a way that the currency is reliable enough to be used instead of something like the USD or the Euro.

It can be transmitted securely, and has value anywhere in the world regardless of what different governments do that could affect their currency. (such as brexit, and Trump) that influence the value of their nation’s currencies.

&lt;h2&gt; How. &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;this is where you want to skip to for more info on the protocol.&lt;/h4&gt;

There are a couple problems to worry about when making an online and decentralized currency, mostly that currency can’t be counterfeited and that the same money can’t be spent twice. The intricacies of those problems are outside the scope of this post, but we’ll talk a bit about what the bitcoin protocol does.

  &lt;p data-section-id=&quot;2&quot; class=&quot;commentable-section&quot;&gt;
    Let’s imagine that &lt;em&gt;Alice and Bob&lt;/em&gt; want to send money to each other using this hypothetical virtual currency. Alice needs to use the internet to do it, and there’s no bank or clearing house to validate it.
  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do we start our transaction? &lt;strong&gt;By having alice declare it to the world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Alice prepares a message stating, “Alice is sending bitcoin &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;82303348&lt;/code&gt; to Bob.” She then &lt;em&gt;encrypts&lt;/em&gt; this message and sends it out to everyone on the bitcoin network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone receives this message, including Bob. When bob gets this message, he knows that Alice sent the money, and so does everyone else. As other people on the network hear that message, each adds it to a list of pending transactions that they’ve been told about, but which haven’t yet been approved by the whole network. The approval process starts with other observers on the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say that an observer on the network, David, checks his copy of the list, and can see that each transaction is valid. He would like to help out by broadcasting news of that validity to the entire network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, before being able to tell anyone as part of the validation protocol David is required to solve an intentionally hard computational puzzle called the proof-of-work. Without the solution to that puzzle, the rest of the network won’t accept his validation of the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without a solution to that puzzle, the rest of the network won’t accept his validation of a transaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The puzzle that he has to solve, is something like the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let $h$ be a fixed hash function known to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;note: a hash function is an operation that attempts to produce a unique signature for each possible input. The hash function used in the bitcoin protocol, for example, is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2&quot;&gt;SHA-256.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose we add a fixed value $x=0$ to a block of transactions $L$ in a peer’s queue. where $h(L+x) = out$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;for simplicity&lt;/em&gt;, we’ll use $L$=&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;hello world&lt;/code&gt;, but this would work the same for any $L$ that could be represented numerically. Even say, &lt;em&gt;a number that encodes a bunch of people sending each other money&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Hello, world!0'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1312&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;af178c253f84028d480a6adc1e25e81caa44c749ec81976192e2ec934c64&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if we set $x=1$ and try that value&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Hello, world!1'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;e9afc424b79e4f6ab42d99c81156d3a17228d6e1eef4139be78e948a9332a7d8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The puzzle &lt;em&gt;solution&lt;/em&gt; might be to find a value of $x$ that creates &lt;strong&gt;4 consecutive zeroes&lt;/strong&gt; at the beginning of the output value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;note-that-this-is-a-problem-that-can-take-a-long-time-to-find-the-answer-to-but-can-be-checked-very-quickly&quot;&gt;Note that this is a problem that can take a long time to find the answer to, but can be checked very quickly.&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we keep incrementing $x$ and &lt;em&gt;recalculating&lt;/em&gt; the SHA value, we won’t actually find an acceptable nonce for this value of $L$ until we get all the way up to $x=4250$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-python highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;'Hello, world!4250'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;mo&quot;&gt;0000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c3af42fc31103f1fdc0151fa747ff87349a4714df7cc52ea464e12dcd4e9&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h6 id=&quot;you-can-check-this-on-your-own-machine-as-well-with-the-sha256sum-command&quot;&gt;you can check this on your own machine as well with the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sha256sum&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-n&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Hello, world!4250'&lt;/span&gt; | sha256sum
0000c3af42fc31103f1fdc0151fa747ff87349a4714df7cc52ea464e12dcd4e9
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important to remember that this is a hypothetical example, and that instead of requiring leading zeroes, the Bitcoin proof-of-work puzzle requires the hash of a &lt;strong&gt;transaction block’s header&lt;/strong&gt; to be &lt;em&gt;lower&lt;/em&gt; than or equal to a number known as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Target&quot;&gt;target&lt;/a&gt;. This &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Target&quot;&gt;target&lt;/a&gt; is automatically adjusted to ensure that a Bitcoin block takes, on average, about ten minutes to validate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it would take a computer a while to find the right value for $x$, but once we know the answer, other computers can use this $x$ value to see if it’s right, and if it is we can say that David’s computer has proof of work for this block of transactions $L$. When he has the answer he sends it out to the other computers on the bitcoin network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone has similar records of all transactions (including the one david’s computer just worked on) that they keep and manage as they hear about them from everyone else, and remember which ones are validated. This /public list of transactions that &lt;strong&gt;everyone shares&lt;/strong&gt; is called &lt;strong&gt;the blockchain&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proof of work puzzle of calculating a &lt;strong&gt;nonce&lt;/strong&gt; ($x$) for a specific block of transactions is called &lt;em&gt;mining&lt;/em&gt;. And the protocol gives monetary rewards to those who mine blocks, making the currency more reliable as other people constantly validate your transactions and share that information with everyone else; and eventually getting to Bob! &lt;strong&gt;This is why it tends to take a couple minutes for someone to confirm it when bitcoin is send to them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s plenty more to this process than what we’ve gone over here, but I hope this was an easy to understand introduction to bitcoin that ignores most of the fluff. If you’re interested, the blockchain ledger itself is managed through a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree&quot;&gt;merkle tree data structure&lt;/a&gt; which is the first place to start reading if you want to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
