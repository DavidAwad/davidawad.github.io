    <h2> Why does Mathematics ... Work?</h2>

<div id="commentable-area">
  <p data-section-id="1" class="commentable-section">
  There is a really interesting question in Mathematics that has went unresolved for a long time now. That question is the issue of Mathematical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominalism">Nominalism</a> vs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonism">Platonism</a>. Platonism is the view that math, ergo, numbers, are things that are inherently true and that there are these abstract mathematical objects that do in fact exist. As we study mathematics we continue to discover truths about reality.
  </p>

Nominalists take the opposing view, that mathematics isn’t necessarily true, but that it’s possible that it just happens to work. This turns out to be a very deep question in Mathematics and Philosophy, and we’re going to have a crack at it today. Lucky you.

So let’s examine this, what makes mathematics, true? As it turns out there are five critical problems issues that you must make a decision on when examining this very deep problem.

How we learn math

How we apply math

Using uniform semantics

The ontological problem


<div data-section-id="3" class="commentable-section">

<h3> The acquisition of mathematical knowledge </h3>

</div>


<div data-section-id="4" class="commentable-section">

The title for this problem that I should have used is, “the epistemological problem of mathematics,” however this article was written for people with friends. It’s actually very simple, How do we actually learn anything about Math? It’s true, everything we learn about math has been based on the world around us that we’ve formalized in our mind. You don’t see something a rock and think, “oh, that’s what ‘2’ is.” You say that you see two rocks.

Given that mathematical objects themselves do not seem to play any role in generating our mathematical beliefs (Field 1989), How the heck do we know what we’re actually making assertions about is true about math in the first place?
</div>

The nominalist doesn’t really care, but the Platonist must find some way to address this very real problem.
</div>

<h3 id="the-use-of-math-in-the-applied-sciences">The use of Math in the Applied Sciences</h3>

<p>Well one of the most relevant uses of math is to model reality, and it does work. But Is this sufficient reason to believe platonism? well… maybe.</p>

<p>If you wanted to deny that numbers existed, than you would have to have some explanation for the success of applied mathematics which has become indispensable to the applied sciences. Platonists would certainly feel that it’s not surprising to believe so.</p>

<p>The nominalist then has to have some way to address this “coincidence” that has resulted in incredible discoveries. How can the nominalist deny the existence of such entities?</p>

<h3 id="the-problem-of-uniform-semantics">The problem of uniform semantics</h3>

<p>When we use mathematics to describe the modern world, and we can even use mixed statements, that have purely math and then mixes it with statements working with the physical world.</p>

<p>For example we can do things in physics where we simply divide by dt and consider that simply a function of time that we can now integrate. And even crazier things that mathematically work! Just look at the derivation of the work energy theorem! You can simply manipulate the definition of acceleration that we’ve created then end up with one of the most essential theorems in all of classical mechanics.</p>

<h3 id="the-ontological-problem">The ontological problem</h3>

<p>The ontological problem consists in specifying the nature of the objects a philosophical conception of mathematics is committed to. Can the nature of these objects be properly determined? Are the objects in question such that we simply lack good grounds to believe in their existence? Traditional forms of platonism have been criticized for failing to offer an adequate solution to this problem.</p>

<h2 id="so-where-does-that-leave-us">So where does that leave us?</h2>

<p>Well, unfortunately the problem remains unsolved as of today.</p>

<p>You might be kind of annoyed thinking, “Well this doesn’t Marty McFly!” And to you I say, “Think about it!” Is this crazy? Is math actually just true and that’s it? Let me know.</p>

<h3 id="post-script">Post-Script</h3>

<p>It is perhaps apparent to you at this point that I find myself on the side of the Platonists, however you may disagree. This also isn’t a very comprehensive overview on all that goes into the consideration of this problem, there’s a breadth of research and argumentation on the truth behind mathematics.</p>

<p>This small essay is really just an informal recap of the modern problem of mathematical philosophy. I absolutely must cite and thank this dictionary entry by the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nominalism-mathematics/#TwoVieAboMatNomPla">Stanford Department of Philosophy</a>.</p>

    <h3 id="picture-a-heap-of-sand-how-many-grains-there-in-order-for-it-to-be-considered-a-heap">Picture a heap of sand. How many grains there in order for it to be considered a heap?</h3>

<p>Well, probably a lot right? Maybe 200? 500? 1000?!</p>

<p>heap — “an untidy collection of things piled up haphazardly.”</p>

<p>Well that’s quite vague, which leads to some interesting conclusions. What if we remove a grain of sand? By definition, you still have your heap on the ground, but now one grain in your hand. It’s still a collection of things.</p>

<p>Wait — If we do still have a heap of sand, strictly after having removed one; then that means that a heap of something, is that which we can remove a small portion of and still be a heap.</p>

<p>But this is problematic; let’s say we began then removing grains of sand one by one, and as we do, our heap simply remains a heap after each grain is removed. So we keep doing this, and eventually we hit a point where we have three grains, two grains, and one grain. But even this far, our heap is still definitionally a heap.</p>

<p>So we have a heap with one thing… a grain of sand. If we remove this grain however, being that a heap is that which we can remove one small portion of and have it still remain a heap, we end up in a position where one grain of sand is a heap, and if we remove that one last grain of sand from this heap, but a heap is a collection such that we may remove a portion and have it remain a heap. But there’s nothing there! When did our “heap” stop being a heap?</p>

<p>“When did our collections of objects stop being such?”</p>

<p>Does this mean that heaps don’t exist? If they don’t have any grains of sand left, but can still be considered a heap, then does that mean that heaps don’t exist? Well we surely can’t call nothing a heap. Let’s try applying this same logic to something other than a heap of sand.</p>

<p>Okay, let’s run with this for a second. What if we take a regular person, and simply remove a small portion of them. Say, an atom. Well that happens every day right? We sneeze, we get bruises, we get haircuts. Parts of our body are constantly removed, yet we insist that we are the same people.</p>

<div id="commentable-area">
  <p data-section-id="1" class="commentable-section">
    Suppose we simply began removing a person’s atoms one by one. And as we’re removing atoms from this person they’re shouting out “I think therefore I am!” At what point does that “heap” of atoms cease to be a human being?

    There’s an important objection that I’d like to address as well. Which is that you could tear this argument apart at the outset and say, “well, you didn’t properly define what a heap was, it’s a collection of things. Because things is plural, and analytically means more than one of something, it is a heap until you have only one grain.”
  </p>

  And it’s a very good point, however you might have no realized that this is a problem that extends far beyond just heaps. You could replace “heap” with “pile” or “stack” or “clump”. The problem actually has nothing to do with the actual word we use. It’s not as if, simply because a word doesn’t make sense suddenly no one exists.

  What we’re actually seeing here is a problem with the __non-specificity__ of human language.

        Can We Compress Stars?
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">01 Sep 2015</span>

    <meta name="description" content="How many times have you looked at the stars? Often I hope! Well its not unrealistic to assume you haven’t. As most people don’t. Especially…" />

<p>How many times have you looked at the stars? Often I hope! Well its not unrealistic to assume you haven’t. As most people don’t. It wasn’t until after college that I myself finally started taking the time to look up.</p>

<p>So why don’t you take one… <em>with</em> you?</p>

<p>We all have smartphones which make it easier to manage work related things as well as a convenient way to see lolcats on the go. Why not have a star too?</p>

<p>Its also been shown that looking at the sun can help improve a person’s psychological health and even physical health. And sunlight, is technically starlight, since, as we all know the sun is a star.</p>

<p>So it would indeed be beneficial to us, if we were to have a star with us at all times. It could be a MUCH more effective flashlight than an LED for starters. But the more important benefit is that it could improve people’s lives. Making people happier on the go.</p>

<p>And with every will, there’s a way (sort-of)!</p>

<p>So to understand how we would be able to keep a star around with us all the time we have to understand how they work.</p>

<p>So now think of a star, what gives it it’s heat? It’s not magic. It’s hydrogen Fusion.</p>

<p>So here’s where we get quantum, or perhaps, nuclear is a better term for it. So, an atom of hydrogen is one of the most common things in the universe as you already know; because it is only one proton and one electron.</p>

<p>Let’s look at this diagram. Don’t get intimidated by the confusing particles and explosions.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/public/img/stars_1.jpeg" alt="stars img 1" /></p>

<p>Look on the left, we can see that there are 4 protons going into a series of reactions, and on the far right, we see that there are only 2 protons left, and a helium-4 atom. So whats happening? Well, in short, hydrogen is becoming helium and less hydrogen. So lets look.</p>

<p>2 protons collide. And out comes a deuteron, a positron and a neutrino. A deuteron is simply a proton attached to a neutron. In the graph we see that the deuteron hits another deuteron created by the same reactions. Once those deuterons hit other protons they become helium-3. (two protons and that bland neutron from before). If you’ve been following along in the diagram, you should be able to tell that two helium-3’s become a helium-4. So now you can officially tell people you understand hydrogen fusion! Hooray.</p>

<p>We don’t really need to focus on the other two right now but if you’re interested here’s a fun video on what a neutrino is.</p>

<div class="video-container"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lAAmAbJvvJg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

<p>Positrons, not to be confused with Decepticons, are the anti particles of electrons. If a particle were ever to make contact with it’s anti-particle the two would both turn into energy and they would create a subatomic explosion-like reaction that would give off photons in opposite directions. Which means it would be dangerous to throw your box into a highly dense field of electrons! But enough about that. Lets get back to Deuterons!</p>

<p>This is how almost all low-mass stars produce energy. So usually, this happens on a MASSIVE scale, which takes billions of hydrogen atoms.So the sun, is in essence a huge ball of incredibly hot burning molecules; and it can get VERY hot. That’s the only way nuclear fusion can happen. When it’s incredibly hot. But how hot can it get? This is a bit off topic but here’s an interesting video on how hot it really can be.</p>

<div class="video-container">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4fuHzC9aTik" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</div>

<p>Although we have seen through the wonders of modern science (as well as begging for grants!), We have been able to create nuclear fusion before, and we know how to create a star. So whats left to do?</p>

<div id="commentable-area">
  <p data-section-id="1" class="commentable-section">
  Shrink it.
  </p>


Well… __how__? for that matter, how do stars get their spherical shape anyway? When you think about it there’s no reason for a star to be a… circle. Well, here’s how it works, when a star is created, it is essentially a conglomeration of very hot gas. This gas continues to get hotter and hotter. If you watched the video above you know that the more heat is applied to a particle the more energy it releases. So then if that’s the case then shouldn’t a star be constantly expanding in random directions determined by where particles happen to conglomerate? Well, yes. However were forgetting something; gravity. Look at this picture. All the material falls inward in the star and a sphere is the most stable shape at equilibrium.

</div>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/public/img/stars_2.png" alt="stars img 2" /></p>

<p>Now we know what really goes into a star. So lets get down to it. Let’s say we want a star similar to the sun, (1.0 Solar Masses) into a small box.</p>

<p>There are a couple things we need to do in order to create this star.</p>

<p>Step 1) Invent and perfect cold fusion (AKA nuclear fusion at room temperature) and create an artificial sun on the surface of the planet. However, Cold fusion has never been perfected, and remember that the diagram I showed you before requires temperatures of several million kelvin!</p>

<p>Step 2) So let’s say you perfect cold fusion, forget the Nobel prizes, you have bigger things in mind, you begin plans to build a laboratory for your artificial sun. But… Where? There is nowhere in the world where CREATING A STAR wouldn’t destroy the planet. Because the planet would burn up. Even if it didn’t burn up completely the earth would lose so much mass that it would eventually just be dragged into the sun by gravity.</p>

<p>Step 3) You would also have to create a box that is capable of withstanding up to at least 5,778 kelvin. The most heat resistant material ever created is carbon in it’s graphite form; and even that can only resist up to 3,965 kelvin. So unfortunately… whatever box you made, would burn up as well.</p>

<p>step 4) Say you were able to solve the box problem too, you create an element that can withstand anything. There’s something else you would have to do. You would have to create a device that can artificially increase gravity that is perpetually active. That way the star would be able to stay in a size that fits in your box and everything would be well in the world. It would then be an incredibly dangerous thing that could never become commercial. Because the second this device stops working, the star would begin to expand due to the lighter force of gravity working against it and probably consume part of the earth, once again dragging it into the sun due to the loss of mass.</p>

<p>Step 5) Now, let’s say that you were able to ignore all of these factors, you’ve mastered cold fusion, found a place and repeatedly created stars and can successfully contain them. There’s one last thing that will stand in the way. If you were to create a star, and condense it into a size suitable for a small box, it would become a black hole. Because it is impossible to take anything incredibly massive and shrink down. The mass has t remain constant. However here is a specific density that cannot be exceeded.</p>

<p>Ironic being that you were trying to create a source of light and happiness.
So… I don’t think we will be able to carry stars around with us for a long time… but for what it’s worth take comfort in the fact that the sun, at least for all of our lifetimes; will always be shining, even if you’re not on the side of the world that can see it, it won’t be gone for long.</p>

        Making a case for Spacetime

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">31 Aug 2015</span>

    <p>Are space and time different things ?</p>

<p>How many dimensions are there?</p>

<p>$x$, $y$, and $z$ right?</p>

<p>How sure are you?</p>

<p>Is time a dimension?</p>

<p>Now when you think about it there is no way to conceptualize a four-dimensional object.</p>

<p>That should be it then, no fourth dimension, right? But what of the fact that you literally are further in time than when you started reading this. You’ve effectively moved forward in time.</p>

<p>So is time a dimension? Time is defined as, and I quote “The indefinite continued progress of existence and events in the past, present, and future regarded as a whole”</p>

<p>Here’s the thing. There’s a very interesting phenomenon called time dilation. The most interesting example of this is a thought experiment known as thetwin paradox. But more on that later; lets try to understand first how motion can affect time.</p>

<p>It sounds crazy right?</p>

<p>The idea behind time dilation is a little complex. But it is central to time as well as space as I will soon prove to you.</p>

<div class="video-container"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KHjpBjgIMVk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div>

<p>If the video above confused you, don’t worry, We’ll get a little technical and prove it mathematically.</p>

<p>Here’s another way to look at it. Say you and a friend are standing next to each other.</p>

<p>Your friend is standing and holding a laser upwards towards a mirror hanging above. Don’t think about how the mirror is floating but just know that it is constantly floating above your friend.You’re both trying to measure how much time [in seconds] it will take for the light to hit the mirror and then come back.</p>

<p>So you’re both standing still with your clocks. He shoots the laser up, it bounces off the mirror and comes back.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/public/img/spacetime_img_1.png" alt="spacetime img 1" /></p>

<p>So for the example in the picture you’re seeing essentially would be the distance L divided by the speed of light [c]. For the sake of simplicity let’s take that value to be 10 seconds. So it takes 10 seconds for the light to bounce off of the mirror and come back. Now when you’re both not moving you will see the light take the same amount of time.</p>

<p>Now let’s say the other person started moving. You’re still standing still, yet now when you measure your times, you measure the time for the light to go up and then back down to be 10.4 seconds as opposed to the 10 seconds before. Your friend tells you that his clock measured 10 seconds just like before.</p>

<h3 id="thats-strange-the-distance-between-the-other-person-and-the-mirror-hasnt-changed-so-why-would-the-time-increase">“That’s strange. The distance between the other person and the mirror hasn’t changed, so why would the time increase?”</h3>

<p>Think back to the video you watched before, and then look at the picture below. Imagine the person starts moving at point A, when the laser is fired. The light is now taking the blue path. It’s no longer taking the path of the picture above because now the person is moving. The distance the light has to travel is now longer because the light is traveling diagonally. Similar to the previous example, when neither of you were moving the light traveled length L and back. (2L) would be less than (2D/c)</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/public/img/spacetime_img_2.png" alt="spacetime img 2" /></p>

<p>So if you measured 10.4 seconds… what does that mean? Well, if you measured 10.4, and he measured 10 seconds, then it would seem that time was moving faster for him than it was for you.
This unusual phenomenon is called time dilation.
Your time was 10.4… why is it that number specifically do you think?
In fact, how would you know how much slower it would be?
It turns out there is a way to calculate this.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">t'=\frac{t}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}</script>

<p>The time that you (the non-moving observer) measure, is denoted by t’. The way you would set the equation up for this specific example would be replacing t’ with 10.4 and t (the time measured by your friend) with 10. The other values you can tell based on the picture.</p>

<p>So how does this happen in everyday life? I don’t think i’ve ever had a different time while i was driving in my car then my friends waiting for me somewhere else. Well, here’s why, the difference is so incredibly small that it doesn’t actually create a problem. Think back to the Twin Paradox I told you about earlier, the idea is that if this principal is taken to the extreme, two twins could end up meeting each other at very different ages after one of the twins gets on a space ship and orbits around the earth.</p>

<p>It’s all probably still a little crazy to wrap your head around the idea of time moving at different rates based on how fast your moving, believe me it’s weird. Here is another video that should help out with how physicists think about this.</p>

<div id="commentable-area">
  <p data-section-id="1" class="commentable-section">
    So what we’ve essentially unraveled here is how to travel in time! Not to the past (unfortunately), but to the future! In fact, you just did it when between now and when you started reading this sentence. trippy.
