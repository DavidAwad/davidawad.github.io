# Papers
---

A section of _slightly_ more formal things I've written.



## Math

- [A little Modulo Lemma by David Awad and Dylan Lesko](https://github.com/DavidAwad/Papers/raw/master/Mathematics/Modulo%20Lemma.pdf)


## Philosophy

- Strictly defining nearby worlds for a coherent theory of true justified and safe beliefs. - TBD

> And just for being awesome and taking an interest in the papers I've written, I'll share an [embarassing secret]({{ site.baseurl }}public/Harmony-DavidAwad.pdf). This is a link to a short children's book I've written and published. For some reason I gave it a really sophisticated name. Please try not to laugh at it too much.
